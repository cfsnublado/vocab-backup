If one considered a band of bandits an \u201carmy,\u201d and if one ignored the fact that the King of Cocru had no idea who Kuni Garu was, the letter could be considered to sort of tell the truth.\n\n But the citizens did as Kuni asked. Chaos erupted in the streets, and the people of the city, long resentful of the heavy hand of Xana rule, made quick work of the mayor and his staff. The heavy gates swung open, and citizens watched in amazement as Kuni Garu and his tiny band of bandits strode in.\n\n \u201cWhere\u2019s the Cocru army?\u201d one of the riot leaders asked.\n\n Kuni climbed onto the balcony of a nearby house and surveyed the throng in the streets.\n\n You are the Cocru army!\u201d he shouted. \u201cDo you see how much power you have when you act without fear? Even if Cocru lives on only in the heart of one man, he will still overthrow Xana!\u201d\n\n Platitude or not, the crowd erupted into applause, and by acclamation, Kuni Garu became the Duke of Zudi. A few pointed out that titles of nobility really couldn\u2019t be handed out in such a democratic fashion, but these killjoys were ignored.",

Kuni had announced before the banquet that since Risana\u2019s son, the young prince known as Hudo-tika, had also reached the age of reason, he would be formally named Phyro, meaning \u201cPearl in the Palm.\u201d\n\n Only a few who had studied the Ano Classics in depth understood the obscure allusion. The Cocru patriot and poet Lurus\u00e9n had once written a poem celebrating the birth of a new prince:\n\n *A son who carries on the legacy of his father*\n\n *Is more precious than a pearl in the palm of a great king.*\n\n Prince Timu\u2019s name, Gentle Ruler, had been an allusion to a son\u2019s love for his mother, but Phyro\u2019s name seemed to indicate Kuni\u2019s thoughts on succession. No wonder Jia\u2019s face had been stony when the name was announced, though Risana had appeared completely oblivious.\n\n From time to time, the sound of children playing and laughing in the courtyard drifted into the banquet hall.\n\n Soto sighed. Risana was in trouble, and she didn\u2019t even know it. Risana thought Kuni\u2019s favor alone was enough, but she did not understand that the politics among the wives and children of the emperor would be far more deadly and intricate.",

He would stare for minutes at trembling ministers who had forgotten to properly address him as \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d He would ask one man to spy on another, only to tell the other one an hour later to spy on the first. How could he be sure that the Black Caps themselves had not been infiltrated by Imperial spies too?\n\n The solution was obvious. He gathered a few men that he especially trusted and gave them the authority to spy on the Black Caps. These men wrapped white kerchiefs knotted at the backs of their heads to signify their elevated level of trust. The first man they accused of treason was the former captain of the guards, leader of the Black Caps\u2014the result disappointed King Huno, but he thought it made perfect sense. Just as a fish rots from the head down, corruption started at the top. Of course the captain of the guards would betray him.\n\n So the Black Caps watched the people, while the White Caps watched the Black Caps. But who was going to watch the White Caps? This troubled King Huno greatly. He thought and thought and came up with the Gray Caps.\n\n Every solution seemed to create a new problem, and King Huno fell into despair.",

The tip of the horn was sharper than the point of a spear, threatening destruction to anything that stood in its way.\n\n Roaring waves dashed against the horn and the barnacle-encrusted forehead below it, breaking into a violent mist that soaked his clothes and sometimes made it hard to open his eyes. Everywhere he looked, sunlight was refracted into rainbows in the salty mist.\n\n The waves divided themselves around the creature they rode on, and from where Dafiro was sitting, he could barely feel them.
