- In the fullness of time all that lives will die. For more than three billion years, as species simple and complex found their place in earth’s hierarchy, the scythe of death has cast a persistent shadow over the flowering of life.

- And yet this looming end, as inevitable as the setting sun, is something only we humans seem to notice. Long before our arrival, the thunderous clap of storm clouds, the raging might of volcanoes, the tremulous shudders of a quaking earth surely sent scurrying everything with the power to scurry. But such flights are an instinctual reaction to a present danger. Most life lives in the moment, with fear born of immediate perception. It is only you and I and the rest of our lot that can reflect on the distant past, imagine the future, and grasp the darkness that awaits.

- Don Quixote speaks to humankind’s yearning for the heroic, told through the fragile Alonso Quijano, a character created in the imagination of Miguel de Cervantes, a living, breathing, thinking, sensing, feeling collection of bone, tissue, and cells that, during his lifetime, supported organic processes of energy transformation and waste excretion, which themselves relied on atomic and molecular movements honed by billions of years of evolution on a planet forged from the detritus of supernova explosions scattered throughout a realm of space emerging from the big bang. Yet to read Don Quixote’s travails is to gain an understanding of human nature that would remain opaque if embedded in a description of the movements of the knight-errant’s molecules and atoms or conveyed through an elaboration of the neuronal processes crackling in Cervantes’s mind while writing the novel. Connected though they surely are, different stories, told with different languages and focused on different levels of reality, provide vastly different insights.

- That is, some life acquired conscious self-awareness. Such self-reflective beings have naturally wondered what consciousness is and how it arose: How can a swirl of mindless matter think and feel? Various researchers, as we will discuss in chapter 5, anticipate a mechanistic explanation. They argue that we need to understand the brain—its components, its functions, its connections—with far greater fidelity than we now do, but once we have that knowledge, an explanation of consciousness will follow. Others anticipate that we are up against a far greater challenge, arguing that consciousness is the most difficult conundrum we have ever encountered, one that will require radically new perspectives regarding not just mind but also the very nature of reality.

- Opinions converge when assessing the impact our cognitive sophistication has had on our behavioral repertoire. Across tens of thousands of generations during the Pleistocene, our forebears joined together in groups that subsisted through hunting and gathering. In time, an emerging mental dexterity provided them with refined capacities to plan and organize and communicate and teach and evaluate and judge and problem-solve.

- However, unlike the opposable thumb or upright gait—inherited physiological features tightly linked to specific adaptive behaviors—many of the brain’s inherited characteristics mold predilections rather than definitive actions. We are influenced by these predispositions but human activity emerges from a comingling of behavioral tendencies with our complex, deliberative, self-reflective minds.

- But the mental faculties that allow us to shape and mold and innovate are the very ones that dispel the myopia that would otherwise keep us narrowly focused on the present. The ability to manipulate the environment thoughtfully provides the capacity to shift our vantage point, to hover above the timeline and contemplate what was and imagine what will be. However much we’d prefer it otherwise, to achieve “I think, therefore I am” is to run headlong into the rejoinder “I am, therefore I will die.”

- Perhaps these and related pursuits are exquisite but adaptively superfluous by-products of a sufficiently large brain released from full-time focus on securing shelter and sustenance. As we will discuss, theories abound but unassailable conclusions are elusive. What lies beyond question is that we imagine and we create and we experience works, from the Pyramids to the Ninth Symphony to quantum mechanics, that are monuments to human ingenuity whose durability, if not whose content, point toward permanence.

- And with that, having considered cosmic origins, explored the formation of atoms, stars, and planets, and swept across the emergence of life, consciousness, and culture, we will cast our sights toward the very realm that for millennia, literally and symbolically, has both stimulated and quelled our cosmic anxiety. We will look, that is, from here to eternity.

- hat’s not at all obvious is that there is a cosmic version of such consequential but parochial concerns. By thinking of thought as a physical process (an assumption we will examine), it is not surprising that thought can take place only when certain stringent environmental conditions are met, whether on earth in the here and now or somewhere else in the there and then.

- How will conscious thought fare in a universe experiencing such transformation? The language for asking and answering this question is provided once again by entropy. And by following the entropic trail we will encounter the all-too-real possibility that the very act of thinking, undertaken by any entity of any kind anywhere, may be thwarted by an unavoidable buildup of environmental waste: in the distant future, anything that thinks may burn up in the heat generated by its own thoughts. Thought itself may become physically impossible.

- While the case against endless thought will be based on a conservative set of assumptions, we will also consider alternatives, possible futures more conducive to life and thinking. But the most straightforward reading suggests that life, and intelligent life in particular, is ephemeral.

- On reflection, neither was the case. We are the product of a long lineage that has soothed its existential discomfort by envisioning that we leave a mark. And the more lasting the mark, the more indelible its imprint, the more a life seems to be a life that mattered.

- Yet, through language and story, art and myth, religion and science, we have harnessed our small part of the dispassionate, relentless, mechanical unfolding of the cosmos to give voice to our pervasive need for coherence and value and meaning.

- In (highly) colloquial terms, the law declares that the production of waste is unavoidable. And what makes the second law vitally important is that while steam engines were the catalyst, the law is universally applicable. The second law describes a fundamental characteristic inherent in all matter and energy, regardless of structure or form, whether animate or inanimate. The law reveals (loosely, again) that everything in the universe has an overwhelming tendency to run down, to degrade, to wither.

- An analogous approach for large groups of atoms and molecules was pioneered by James Clerk Maxwell, Rudolf Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann, and many of their colleagues. They advocated jettisoning detailed consideration of individual trajectories in favor of statistical statements describing the average behavior of large collections of particles.

- This was all a great triumph and has allowed physicists to understand not only steam engines but also a broad range of thermal systems—from earth’s atmosphere, to the solar corona, to the vast collection of particles swarming within a neutron star. But how does this relate to Russell’s vision of the future, his prognostication of a universe crawling toward death? Good question. Hang tight. We’re getting there. But we still have a couple of steps to go. The next is to use these advances to shed light on the quintessential quality of the future: it differs profoundly from the past.

- Which means that if the laws allow for a particular sequence of events to occur, then the laws necessarily permit the reverse sequence too.7

    As a student, when I first learned about this, it struck me as just shy of ludicrous. In the real world we don’t see Olympic divers popping out of pools feetfirst and landing calmly on springboards. We don’t see shards of stained glass jumping up from the floor and reassembling into a Tiffany lamp. Clips from films run in reverse are amusing for the very reason that what we see projected differs so thoroughly from anything we experience. And yet, according to the math, the events depicted in reverse-run clips are fully in keeping with the laws of physics.

- Entropy is among the more confusing concepts in fundamental physics, a fact that has not diminished the cultural appetite for freely invoking it to describe everyday situations that have evolved from order to chaos or, more simply, from good to bad. As colloquial usage goes, this is fine; at times, I’ve invoked entropy that way too. But as the scientific conception of entropy will guide our journey—and also lies at the heart of Russell’s dark vision of the future—let’s tease out its more precise meaning.

- Whether the bouncing particles are in a steam engine, in your room, or anywhere else, by understanding the typical features of the most commonplace configurations (those that belong to the groupings with the greatest membership), we can make predictions about the system’s macroscopic qualities—the very qualities we care about. These are statistical predictions, to be sure, but ones with a fantastically high probability of being accurate. And the kicker is that we achieve all this while avoiding the insurmountable complexity of analyzing the trajectories of an absurdly large number of particles.

- Temperature next. At the level of molecules, what do we mean by temperature? The answer is well-known. Temperature is the average speed of a collection of molecules.11 Something is cold when the average speed of its molecules is low and it is hot when the average speed is high. So determining how temperature affects entropy is tantamount to determining how the average molecular speed affects entropy. And much as we found with molecular positions, a qualitative assessment is close at hand.

- To summarize: Having fewer molecules, or having lower temperature, or filling a smaller volume results in lower entropy. Having more molecules, or having higher temperature, or filling a larger volume results in higher entropy.
