- In our era, scientists equipped with the tools of experiment, observation, and mathematical analysis have blazed a new trail toward the future, one that for the first time has revealed prominent features of the eventual if still far-off landscape-to-be. Although obscured by mist here and fog there, the panorama is becoming sufficiently clear that we cogitating creatures can glean more fully than ever before how we fit into the grand expanse of time.

- Across the millennia, one consequence has been a widespread fascination with all things, real or imagined, that touch on the timeless. From prophesies of an afterlife, to teachings of reincarnation, to entreaties of the windswept mandala, we have developed strategies to contend with knowledge of our impermanence and, often with hope, sometimes with resignation, to gesture toward eternity.

- And yet this looming end, as inevitable as the setting sun, is something only we humans seem to notice. Long before our arrival, the thunderous clap of storm clouds, the raging might of volcanoes, the tremulous shudders of a quaking earth surely sent scurrying everything with the power to scurry. But such flights are an instinctual reaction to a present danger. Most life lives in the moment, with fear born of immediate perception. It is only you and I and the rest of our lot that can reflect on the distant past, imagine the future, and grasp the darkness that awaits.

- Don Quixote speaks to humankind’s yearning for the heroic, told through the fragile Alonso Quijano, a character created in the imagination of Miguel de Cervantes, a living, breathing, thinking, sensing, feeling collection of bone, tissue, and cells that, during his lifetime, supported organic processes of energy transformation and waste excretion, which themselves relied on atomic and molecular movements honed by billions of years of evolution on a planet forged from the detritus of supernova explosions scattered throughout a realm of space emerging from the big bang. Yet to read Don Quixote’s travails is to gain an understanding of human nature that would remain opaque if embedded in a description of the movements of the knight-errant’s molecules and atoms or conveyed through an elaboration of the neuronal processes crackling in Cervantes’s mind while writing the novel. Connected though they surely are, different stories, told with different languages and focused on different levels of reality, provide vastly different insights.

- That is, some life acquired conscious self-awareness. Such self-reflective beings have naturally wondered what consciousness is and how it arose: How can a swirl of mindless matter think and feel? Various researchers, as we will discuss in chapter 5, anticipate a mechanistic explanation. They argue that we need to understand the brain—its components, its functions, its connections—with far greater fidelity than we now do, but once we have that knowledge, an explanation of consciousness will follow. Others anticipate that we are up against a far greater challenge, arguing that consciousness is the most difficult conundrum we have ever encountered, one that will require radically new perspectives regarding not just mind but also the very nature of reality.

- Opinions converge when assessing the impact our cognitive sophistication has had on our behavioral repertoire. Across tens of thousands of generations during the Pleistocene, our forebears joined together in groups that subsisted through hunting and gathering. In time, an emerging mental dexterity provided them with refined capacities to plan and organize and communicate and teach and evaluate and judge and problem-solve.

- However, unlike the opposable thumb or upright gait—inherited physiological features tightly linked to specific adaptive behaviors—many of the brain’s inherited characteristics mold predilections rather than definitive actions. We are influenced by these predispositions but human activity emerges from a comingling of behavioral tendencies with our complex, deliberative, self-reflective minds.

- But the mental faculties that allow us to shape and mold and innovate are the very ones that dispel the myopia that would otherwise keep us narrowly focused on the present. The ability to manipulate the environment thoughtfully provides the capacity to shift our vantage point, to hover above the timeline and contemplate what was and imagine what will be. However much we’d prefer it otherwise, to achieve “I think, therefore I am” is to run headlong into the rejoinder “I am, therefore I will die.”

As we will discuss, theories abound but unassailable conclusions are elusive. What lies beyond question is that we imagine and we create and we experience works, from the Pyramids to the Ninth Symphony to quantum mechanics, that are monuments to human ingenuity whose durability, if not whose content, point toward permanence.

- hat’s not at all obvious is that there is a cosmic version of such consequential but parochial concerns. By thinking of thought as a physical process (an assumption we will examine), it is not surprising that thought can take place only when certain stringent environmental conditions are met, whether on earth in the here and now or somewhere else in the there and then.

- Russell, whose innovative writings in philosophy and humanitarian principles would earn him the 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature, and whose iconoclastic political and social views would earn him a pink slip from both Cambridge University and the City College of New York, provided numerous arguments for questioning, if not rejecting, the existence of a creator.

- How will conscious thought fare in a universe experiencing such transformation? The language for asking and answering this question is provided once again by entropy. And by following the entropic trail we will encounter the all-too-real possibility that the very act of thinking, undertaken by any entity of any kind anywhere, may be thwarted by an unavoidable buildup of environmental waste: in the distant future, anything that thinks may burn up in the heat generated by its own thoughts. Thought itself may become physically impossible.

- In (highly) colloquial terms, the law declares that the production of waste is unavoidable. And what makes the second law vitally important is that while steam engines were the catalyst, the law is universally applicable. The second law describes a fundamental characteristic inherent in all matter and energy, regardless of structure or form, whether animate or inanimate. The law reveals (loosely, again) that everything in the universe has an overwhelming tendency to run down, to degrade, to wither.

- An analogous approach for large groups of atoms and molecules was pioneered by James Clerk Maxwell, Rudolf Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann, and many of their colleagues.

- The traditional scientific perspective, handed down in mathematical form by Isaac Newton, is that physical laws provide ironclad predictions for how things move. Tell me the location and velocity of an object at a particular moment, tell me the forces that are acting upon it, and Newton’s equations do the rest, predicting the object’s subsequent trajectory. Be it the moon pulled by earth’s gravity or a baseball you just whacked toward center field, observations have confirmed that these predictions are spot-on accurate.

- Notwithstanding the naysayers, it didn’t take long for statistical reasoning to prove its worth. In 1905, Einstein himself quantitatively explained the jittery motion of pollen grains suspended in a glass of water by invoking the continual bombardment by H2O molecules.

- This was all a great triumph and has allowed physicists to understand not only steam engines but also a broad range of thermal systems—from earth’s atmosphere, to the solar corona, to the vast collection of particles swarming within a neutron star. But how does this relate to Russell’s vision of the future, his prognostication of a universe crawling toward death? Good question. Hang tight. We’re getting there. But we still have a couple of steps to go. The next is to use these advances to shed light on the quintessential quality of the future: it differs profoundly from the past.

- Which means that if the laws allow for a particular sequence of events to occur, then the laws necessarily permit the reverse sequence too.7

    As a student, when I first learned about this, it struck me as just shy of ludicrous. In the real world we don’t see Olympic divers popping out of pools feetfirst and landing calmly on springboards. We don’t see shards of stained glass jumping up from the floor and reassembling into a Tiffany lamp. Clips from films run in reverse are amusing for the very reason that what we see projected differs so thoroughly from anything we experience. And yet, according to the math, the events depicted in reverse-run clips are fully in keeping with the laws of physics.

- Entropy is among the more confusing concepts in fundamental physics, a fact that has not diminished the cultural appetite for freely invoking it to describe everyday situations that have evolved from order to chaos or, more simply, from good to bad. As colloquial usage goes, this is fine; at times, I’ve invoked entropy that way too. But as the scientific conception of entropy will guide our journey—and also lies at the heart of Russell’s dark vision of the future—let’s tease out its more precise meaning.

- Start with an analogy. Imagine you vigorously shake a bag containing a hundred pennies and then dump them out on your dining room table. If you found that all hundred pennies were heads, you’d surely be surprised. But why? Seems obvious, but it’s worth thinking through. The absence of even a single tail means each of the hundred coins, randomly flipping, bumping, and jostling, must hit the table and land heads up. All of them. That’s tough. Getting that unique outcome is a tall order. By comparison, if we consider even a slightly different outcome, say in which we have a single tail (and the other 99 pennies are still all heads), there are a hundred different ways this can happen: the lone tail could be the first coin, or it could be the second coin, or the third, and so on up to the hundredth coin. Getting 99 heads is thus a hundred times easier—a hundred times more likely—than getting all heads.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- The key realization is that these groups do not have equal membership. Not even close. That made it obvious why you’d be shocked for a random shake of the pennies to yield no tails (a group with precisely 1 member), slightly less shocked for a random shake to yield one tail (a group with 100 members), a touch less shocked still to find two tails (a group with 4,950 members), but you’d yawn if the shake yields a configuration that’s half heads and half tails (a group with roughly one hundred billion billion billion members). The greater the membership in a given group, the more likely it is that a random outcome will belong to that group. Group size matters.

    If this material is new to you, you may not realize that we have now illustrated the essential concept of entropy. The entropy of a given configuration of the pennies is the size of its group—the number of fellow configurations that pretty much look like the given configuration. If there are many such look-alikes, the given configuration has high entropy. If there are few such look-alikes, the given configuration has low entropy. All else being equal, a random shake is more likely to belong to a group with higher entropy since such groups have more members.

- Whether the bouncing particles are in a steam engine, in your room, or anywhere else, by understanding the typical features of the most commonplace configurations (those that belong to the groupings with the greatest membership), we can make predictions about the system’s macroscopic qualities—the very qualities we care about. These are statistical predictions, to be sure, but ones with a fantastically high probability of being accurate. And the kicker is that we cachieve all this while avoiding the insurmountable complexity of analyzing the trajectories of an absurdly large number of particles.

- Temperature next. At the level of molecules, what do we mean by temperature? The answer is well-known. Temperature is the average speed of a collection of molecules.11 Something is cold when the average speed of its molecules is low and it is hot when the average speed is high. So determining how temperature affects entropy is tantamount to determining how the average molecular speed affects entropy. And much as we found with molecular positions, a qualitative assessment is close at hand.

- To summarize: Having fewer molecules, or having lower temperature, or filling a smaller volume results in lower entropy. Having more molecules, or having higher temperature, or filling a larger volume results in higher entropy.

- What’s true for the pennies is true more generally. Bake bread and you can be sure that the aroma will shortly fill rooms far from the kitchen. At first, the molecules released as the bread bakes are clustered near the oven. But those molecules will gradually disperse. The reason, similar to our explanation with the pennies, is that there are many more ways for the aroma molecules to spread compared with ways for them to cluster. It is thus overwhelmingly more probable that through random bumping and jostling the molecules will waft outward as opposed to clump inward. The low-entropy configuration of molecules clustered near the oven thus naturally evolves toward the higher-entropy state in which they are spread throughout your house.

- Before the explosion, we say that the dynamite’s energy is high quality: it’s concentrated and easy to access. After the explosion, we say that the energy is low quality: it’s spread out and difficult to utilize. And since the exploding dynamite fully abides by the second law, going from order to disorder—from low entropy to high entropy—we associate low entropy with high-quality energy and high entropy with low-quality energy. Yes, I know. It’s a lot of highs and lows to keep track of. But the conclusion is pithy: whereas the first law of thermodynamics declares that the quantity of energy is conserved over time, the second law declares that the quality of that energy deteriorates over time.

    Why then is the future different from the past? The answer, apparent from what we’ve now developed, is that the energy powering the future is of lower quality than that powering the past. The future has higher entropy than the past.

- For an everyday physical system made from far more than a hundred constituents, the odds against entropy decreasing become all the more daunting. As bread bakes it releases billions upon billions of molecules. Configurations in which those molecules spread throughout your home are spectacularly more numerous than those in which they collectively stream back toward the oven. Through their random jostling and bumping, the molecules could retrace their steps, find their way back to the loaf, fully undo the cooking process, and leave you with a mound of cold raw dough. But the odds of that happening are closer to zero than the likelihood of splattering paint on a canvas and replicating the Mona Lisa. Even so, the point is that were such an entropy-reversing process to happen, it would not contravene the laws of physics. While spectacularly unlikely, the laws of physics do allow entropy to go down.

- Dutifully following the second law, we conclude that today’s state derives from yesterday’s even lower entropy state. And that state, we envision, derives from the day-before-yesterday’s still lower entropy state, and so on, yielding a trail of ever-decreasing entropy taking us ever farther back in time until we finally reach the big bang. A highly ordered, exceedingly low entropy starting point at the big bang is why today’s universe is not entropically maxed out, allowing for an eventful future that differs from the past.

- For now we note that our survival requires order, from our internal molecular organization supporting a wealth of life-sustaining functions, to the food sources that provide us with high-quality energy, to the crafted tools and habitats that are essential for our continued existence. Without an environment chock-full of low-entropy ordered structures, we humans would not be here to notice.

- So, much as with heat, there is a sense in which entropy can flow. For the pan, it flows from the handle to your hand. The handle becomes a little more ordered and your hand becomes a little less ordered. Again, the flow is not in the form of a tangible substance that was initially in the handle and has now moved to your hand. Rather, the entropy flow denotes an interaction between the molecules in the handle and those in your hand that affects the properties of each. In this case, it changes their average speeds—their respective temperatures—and that, in turn, affects the entropy they each contain.

    As the description makes manifest, the flow of heat and the flow of entropy are intimately connected. To absorb heat is to absorb energy that is carried by random molecular motion. That energy, in turn, drives the receiving molecules to move more quickly or spread more widely, thus contributing to an increase in entropy. The conclusion, then, is that to shift entropy from here to there, heat needs to flow from here to there. And when heat flows from here to there, entropy shifts from here to there. In short, entropy rides the wave of flowing heat.

- What does that imply for entropy? Well, since entropy is a count of the microscopic configurations that present as the same macrostate, if the macrostate of the steam engine is reset at the start of each new cycle, then its entropy must be reset too. Which means that the entropy the steam engine acquires during a given cycle (as it absorbs heat from the burning fuel, as it generates additional heat through friction of its moving parts, and so on) must all be expelled to the environment by the time the cycle concludes. How does the steam engine accomplish this? Well, we’ve seen that to transfer entropy you must transfer heat. Thus, for the steam engine to reset itself for the next cycle, _it must release heat into the environment_. That’s the historical statement of the second law of thermodynamics, the inevitable expunging of waste heat into the environment—the very degradation that so weighed on Bertrand Russell—now derived from the statistical version of the second law

- A cooler environment thus amplifies a given amount of heat received into a larger entropic increase. With that realization, we see that the steam engine can discharge all of the entropy it acquires from the hotter fuel by expelling only part of that heat to the cooler environment. The remaining heat is then available to drive the steam to expand, pushing the piston and accomplishing useful work.

    That’s the explanation, but don’t let the details cloud the larger conclusion: over time, physical systems will, with fantastic likelihood, evolve from configurations of lower entropy toward configurations of higher entropy. If a system, like a steam engine, seeks to maintain its structural integrity, it must stave off the natural drive toward increased entropy by transferring the entropy it builds up to its surroundings. To do so, the engine must release waste heat to the environment.

- The entropic two-step lies at the heart of how a universe heading toward ever-greater disorder can nevertheless yield and support ordered structures like stars, planets, and people. A theme we will encounter repeatedly is that when energy flows through a system—like the energy from burning coal flowing through the steam, driving work, and then exiting to the surrounding environment—it carries away entropy and can thus sustain or even produce order in its wake.

    It is this entropic dance that will choreograph the rise of life and mind, as well as most everything that minds deem to matter.

- We can now appreciate more fully Russell’s mind-set when imagining the far future. We are all waging a relentless battle to resist the persistent accumulation of waste, the unstoppable rise of entropy. For us to survive, the environment must absorb and carry away all the waste, all the entropy, we generate. Which raises the question, Does the environment—by which we now mean the observable universe—provide a bottomless pit for absorbing such waste? Can life dance the entropic two-step indefinitely? Or might there come a time when the universe is, in effect, stuffed and so is unable to absorb the waste heat generated by the very activities that define us, bringing an end to life and mind? In the lachrymose phrasing of Russell, is it true that “all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man’s achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins”?

- It’s the kind of question a physicist would ask. More often than not, physicists are reductionists and so tend to look beneath complex phenomena for explanations that rely on properties and interactions of simpler constituents. Whereas biologists often define life by its core activities—life imbibes raw materials for powering self-sustaining functions, eliminates waste generated by the process, and in the most successful instances reproduces—Schrödinger sought an answer to “What is life?” that would draw on life’s fundamental physical underpinnings.

- The sciences are not separate. And when focus shifts from life to intelligent life, yet other overlapping disciplines—language, literature, philosophy, history, art, myth, religion, psychology, and so on—become central to the chronicle. Even the staunch reductionist realizes that as fatuous as it would be to explain a baseball’s trajectory in terms of molecular motion, it would only be more so to invoke such a microscopic perspective in explaining what a batter was feeling as the pitcher went through his windup, the crowd roared, and the fastball approached. Instead, higher-level stories told in the language of human reflection provide far greater insight.

- Nevertheless—and this is key—these better-suited human-level stories must be compatible with the reductionist account. We are physical creatures subject to physical law. And so there’s little to be gained by physicists clamoring that theirs is the most fundamental explanatory framework or from humanists scoffing at the hubris of unbridled reductionism. A refined understanding is gleaned by integrating each discipline’s story into a finely textured narrative.

- Here, we will discuss the origin of the atomic and molecular ingredients necessary for life, the origin of one particular environment—the earth and sun—in which those ingredients have comingled in just the right way for life to arise and flourish, and we will explore the deep unity of life on earth by examining some of the astounding microphysical structures and processes common to all living things. Although we won’t answer the question of life’s origin (still a mystery), we will see that all life on earth can be traced to a common single-celled ancestral species, sharply delineating what a science of life’s origin will ultimately need to explain. This will lead us to examine life from the broadly applicable thermodynamic perspective developed in previous chapters, making clear that living things share a deep kinship not just with one another but with stars and steam engines too: life is one more means the universe employs to release the entropy potential locked within matter.

- Grind up anything previously alive, pry apart its complex molecular machinery, and you’ll find an abundance of the same six types of atoms: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, a collection of elements students sometimes remember with the acronym SPONCH (not to be confused with the Mexican marshmallow cookie of the same name). Where do these life-supporting atomic ingredients come from? The answer that has emerged represents one of the great success stories of modern cosmology.

- The second catch, which became clear later on, is that building up complex atoms is an intricate process that requires time. It requires a highly specific series of steps in which prescribed numbers of protons and neutrons are melded together into various lumps, which then need to fortuitously encounter particular complementary lumps, fuse with them too, and so on. Like a gourmet’s recipe, the order in which the ingredients are combined is essential. And what makes the process particularly tricky is that some intermediate lumps are unstable, meaning that after they form they tend to disintegrate quickly, disrupting the culinary preparations and slowing atomic synthesis.

- We pause at iron, for good reason. Of all atomic species, iron’s protons and neutrons are bound together most tightly. This matters. If you try to build yet heavier atomic species by cramming in additional protons and neutrons, you’ll find that the iron nuclei have little interest in participating. The nuclear bear hug gripping together iron’s twenty-six protons and thirty neutrons has already squeezed out and released as much energy as is physically possible. To add protons and neutrons would require a net input—not output—of energy. As a result, when we reach iron, stellar fusion’s orderly production of larger and more complex atoms, with the accompanying release of heat and light, grinds to a halt. Like ash that’s fallen to the hearth of your fireplace, iron can’t be burned further.

- Scientists have identified two sources for these elements. When a star’s core is mostly iron, fusion reactions no longer generate the outward pushing energy and pressure necessary to counteract the inward pull of gravity. The star begins to collapse. If the star is massive enough, this collapse accelerates into an implosion so powerful that the core temperature rockets; the imploding material bounces off the core and triggers a spectacular shock wave that surges outward. And as the shock wave rumbles from the core toward the star’s surface, it compresses the nuclei it encounters with such fury that a slew of larger nuclear agglomerations form. In the maelstrom of chaotic particle motion, all of the periodic table’s heavier elements can be synthesized, and when the shock wave finally reaches the star’s surface, it blasts the rich atomic smorgasbord into space.

- A second source of heavy elements is the violent collisions between neutron stars, celestial bodies produced in the death throes of stars whose mass is roughly ten to thirty times that of the sun. That neutron stars are mostly made of neutrons—chameleonic particles that can transform into protons—bodes well for building atomic nuclei, as we have a profusion of the right raw materials. One obstacle, though, is that to form atomic nuclei the neutrons need to free themselves from the star’s powerful gravitational grip. That’s where a collision between neutron stars comes in handy. The impact can throw off plumes of neutrons, which, having no electric charge and thus experiencing no electromagnetic repulsion, more easily coalesce into groups. After some of these neutrons then flip the chameleonic switch and become protons (releasing electrons and anti-neutrinos in the process), we acquire a supply of complex atomic nuclei.

- Fused in stars and ejected in supernova explosions, or jettisoned by stellar collisions and amalgamated in particle plumes, an assortment of atomic species float through space, where they swirl together and coalesce into large clouds of gas, which over yet more time clump anew into stars and planets, and ultimately into us. Such is the origin of the ingredients constituting anything and everything you have ever encountered.

- During the next few million years, the detritus left over from the sun’s formation, amounting to just a few tenths of a percent of the original swirling disk, coalesced through numerous instances of gravitational snowballing into the solar system’s planets.

- Schrödinger’s math provides the answer, a universal fire code that applies to all quantum theaters: at most two electrons are allowed on tier one, eight electrons on tier two, eighteen on tier three, and so forth, as specified by the equation. Should an atom’s energy be pumped up, say, by having been zapped by a powerful laser, some of its electrons may be sufficiently agitated to jump up to a higher tier, but this exuberance will be short-lived. Such excited electrons quickly fall back to their original tier, emitting energy (carried away by photons) and returning the atom to its calmest configuration

- The math also reveals one further peculiarity, a kind of atomic OCD that’s a primary driver of chemical reactions throughout the cosmos. Atoms have an aversion to tiers that are only partially filled. Tiers that are empty? Fine. Tiers that are full? Fine. But partial occupancy? That drives atoms up the wall. Some atoms are lucky, being endowed with just the right number of electrons to achieve full occupancy on their own. Helium contains two electrons, to balance the electric charge of its two protons, and they happily fill the first tier. Neon has ten electrons, to balance the electric charge of its ten protons, and they just as happily fill its first tier, which accommodates two, and its second tier, which accommodates the remaining eight. But for most atoms, the number of electrons needed to balance the number of protons does not fill a complete set of tiers.

- The distribution of electrical charge across a water molecule might seem like an esoteric detail. But it’s not. It proves essential to the emergence of life. Because of water’s skewed charge distribution, it can dissolve nearly everything. The negatively charged oxygen vertex grabs hold of anything with even a slight positive charge; the positively charged hydrogen tips grab hold of anything with even a slight negative charge. In tandem, the two ends of a water molecule act like charged claws that pull apart most anything that’s submerged for a sufficient time.

- Well beyond its utility in personal hygiene, water’s capacity to grab hold of and ingest substances is indispensable to life. Cell interiors are miniature chemistry labs whose workings require the rapid movement of a vast collection of ingredients: nutrients in, waste out, comingling of chemicals to synthesize substances required for cellular function, and so on.

- Having surveyed the synthesis of simple and complex atoms, the origin of the sun and earth, the nature of chemical reactions and the necessity of water, we are now equipped to turn to life itself. While it might seem natural to begin with the genesis of life, that topic, still unsettled, is better approached after exploring the quintessential molecular qualities of life itself.

- We don’t know the exact number of distinct species on earth, microbes to manatees, but studies have provided estimates ranging from a low in the millions to a high in the trillions. Whatever the exact number, it’s huge. The wealth of different species, however, belies the singular nature of life’s inner workings.

- Two ubiquitous qualities of life make the case yet more convincing. Each illustrates the deep commonalities shared by all that lives. The first, and more familiar, concerns _information_: how cells encode and utilize the information that directs life-sustaining functions. The second, equally important but less widely celebrated, concerns _energy_: how cells harness, store, and deploy the energy required for carrying out life-sustaining functions. In both we will see that clear across the spectacular breadth of life on earth the detailed processes are identical.

- For an automated system, the description is literal. Drones, self-driving cars, Roombas, and so on are governed by software that takes environmental data as input and as output determines a response executed by onboard hardware, from wings to rotors to wheels. For a rabbit, the description is metaphor. Nevertheless, the software-hardware paradigm is a particularly useful way of thinking about life too. The rabbit accumulates sensory data from the environment, runs it through a “neural computer” (its brain), which sends information-laden signals down nerve pathways—eat clover patch, hop over fallen twigs, and so on—generating physical actions. The motion of the rabbit arises from the internal processing and transmission of a complex set of instructions that flows through its physical structure: biological software driving biological hardware. Such processes are wholly absent for a rock.
