- As he chanted, the storyteller banged a coconut husk against a large kitchen spoon to simulate the sounds of sword clanging against shield; he leapt about, whipping his long sleeves this way and that to conjure the martial dance of legendary heroes in the flickering firelight of the pub. As his voice rose and fell, urgent one moment, languorous the next, the audience was transported to another time and place.

- “This is just a story,” Théra said. “Fighting nonstop for nine days and nine nights—how can you believe that really happened? Think: The storyteller wasn’t there, how would he know what the Hegemon and Mocri said?” But seeing the disappointment on her little brother’s face, she softened her tone. “If you want to hear real stories about heroes, I’ll tell you later about the time Auntie Soto stopped the Hegemon from hurting Mother and us. I was only three then, but I remember it as though it happened yesterday.”

    Phyro’s eyes brightened and he was about to ask for more, but a rough voice broke in.

    “I’ve had just about enough of this ridiculous tale, you insolent fraud!”

- “How dare you fabricate such stories about that crook Mata Zyndu? He tried to thwart Emperor Ragin’s righteous march to the throne and caused much needless suffering and desolation. By praising the despicable tyrant Zyndu, you’re denigrating the victory of our wise emperor and casting aspersions upon the character of the Dandelion Throne. These are words of treason.”

- The wife smiled ingratiatingly. “How about a flask of plum wine on the house? If you and Tino drink together, I’m sure you’ll forget about this little misunderstanding.”

    “What makes you think I want to have a drink with him?” asked Tino the storyteller, whipping his sleeves contemptuously at Scarface.

- The shouting among the patrons died down, and even Tino lost his confident look. Although Scarface looked more like a highwayman than a government official, Duke Coda, who was in charge of Emperor Ragin’s spies, was said to run his department in collaboration with the seedier elements of Dara society. It wouldn’t be beyond him to rely on someone like Scarface. Even though no one in the pub had ever heard of a storyteller getting in trouble for an embellished tale about the Hegemon, Duke Coda’s duties did include ferreting out traitors and dissatisfied former nobles plotting against the emperor. No one wanted to risk challenging the emperor’s own trusted eyes.

- _Kiji, my brother, still so humorless after all these years. Like you, I’ve come to observe Kuni’s contest of intellects, a trial of sharp words and stalwart logograms. You have my sympathies for the tribulations of your studious young lady, but I assure you I had nothing to do with the man who ruined her day—doesn’t mean that I won’t have anything more to do with him, though, now that he’s gotten my interest. However, you’re acting so outraged that one wonders who’s the girl and who’s the patron god._

- On and on the boy and the man raced through the streets of Pan, careless of the astonished looks of the passersby. Solofi’s lungs burned as he panted in the icy air; his legs felt leaden as he stumbled and slipped through the snow. The boy, however, was sure-footed like a goat on the snowbound cliffs of Mount Rapa, and seemed to taunt him by staying just a step ahead, barely out of his grasp. Several times he decided to stop and give up the chase, but each time, as he did so, the boy turned and lobbed another snowball at him. Solofi could not understand how the boy had so much strength and endurance—it seemed unnatural—but rage had driven reason from his mind, and all he could think of was the pleasure he would feel when he crushed the skull of that nasty urchin against some wall.

- “Very good, Suadégo. The spirits are pleased with your progress. Tomorrow you can dance in the second line. Don’t you feel all energized? Ah, these are the new envelopes . . . let me count how many blessed faith tokens you and your recruits have sold . . . only two new recruits from this past week? I’m disappointed! You and your husband need to talk to everyone in the family—cousins, second cousins, their children and the children’s spouses, and their cousins—everyone! Remember, your faith is evinced by the size of your contribution, and the more people you recruit to spread the faith, the more pleased the spirits will be! Here’s your prize—it’s a negotiation pill. Hold it under your tongue before you have to talk to a supplier and visualize success, you understand? You must believe or it won’t work!”

- During the Chrysanthemum-Dandelion War, Noda and Doru tumbled from their thrones before the might of Gin Mazoti’s army and were cast out of the Hegemon’s favor. They had then drifted around the Islands as fugitives in subsequent years, making a living as bandits, highwaymen, merchants of rotten meat and spoiled fish, kidnappers, scammers . . . while hiding from Emperor Ragin’s constables.

- Noda waved his hand to indicate that he had smoked enough. Instead, he took a sip from a flask, letting the throat-burning liquor warm him against the bitter cold. “You’ve certainly put your impressive muscles to good use. That trick with the teahouse storytellers is pretty good. Thanks for sharing the tip; I’ll have to give it a try.”

    “It wouldn’t work for you. They wouldn’t be scared enough,” said Solofi, looking contemptuously at Noda’s thin, small figure. “But your pyramid scheme isn’t bad either. How were you able to convince so many fools to dance for you and give you money?”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: contemptous: contemptously

    </div>

-  “Oh, believe it. Never underestimate the power of the need to appear better than their peers to motivate people, a tendency that I’m happy to indulge. I set up little competitions, promoting dancers from the back to the front if they appear more faithful and demoting them if they’re not as enthusiastic. I give them prizes based on how fervently they gyrate and strut. I tell them that they’re ready to be spiritual teachers on their own, and have them go out to recruit their own magic dance students—and, of course, I collect a portion of the tuition they get. Nothing convinces a fool to believe in a scam better than turning him into a scammer too. I do believe that I could show up naked one of these days and tell them that only the devout can see my spiritual outfit; they would outdo each other in describing the glory of my raiment.”

    At this, Solofi’s eyes dimmed momentarily. “Once we did dress in the finest water silk embroidered in gold, you and I.”

    “We did,” agreed Noda, his tone equally somber. But then his eyes brightened as he examined Solofi. “Perhaps we can again.”

- “There are others who think like you and me—disgraced nobles, the Hegemon’s veterans, scholars who failed to place in the examinations, merchants who can’t make as much profit as they like by cheating at taxes. . . . Dara may be a land at peace, but the hearts of men are never peaceful. I have learned much about fanning the flames of dissatisfaction, and you have a figure that is meant to ride at the head of a crowd. The gods meant for us to meet here today, and we can reclaim the glory that is our due from the weed-emperor. Remember, he was once no better than we.”

- “Fara is four! I’m sure the others would have taken her if they didn’t think she’d get in the way of whatever mischief they were planning. And they had the audacity to have their servants rustling paper in their rooms so that if I walked by I’d think they were working!”

    “Of course such childish tricks would not be effective against a perspicacious teacher such as—”

    “That is not the point! Empress, you know that I have tried my best to teach the children, but even the most patient man has limits. Running away from their punishment essays was bad enough, but look at this. Look!” He dropped the satchel from his shoulder and twisted around to show the empress the back of his robe.

    In childish zyndari letters, a couplet was painted on the fabric:

    _I play the zither for the ruminating cow,_

    _The cow speaks: Moo-moo-moo-moo, why such knitted brow?_

- Ruthi glared at them. “Do you think it’s funny to be compared to the foolish man in Lurusén’s poem who played the zither for cows and then complained about not being understood? No wonder learning has such a hard time taking root in such thin soil.” Empress Jia’s retinue blanched and looked away.

- Ada-_tika_, whose formal name was Princess Fara, was Kuni’s youngest daughter. As her mother, Consort Fina, had died early, all the other children tried to be extra solicitous of her.

- Gin had always liked Phyro the most of all of Kuni’s children. This was only in part because Phyro was bright and always begged her for stories about the war. In truth, Gin had a better rapport with Consort Risana than Kuni’s other wives. During the time of Kuni’s rise, Jia was held by the Hegemon as a hostage while Risana rode by Kuni’s side, and Gin had come to respect her as an adviser to the king. Secretly, she hoped that Kuni would designate Phyro the crown prince.

- “I heard the empress tell Prime Minister Yelu that she wanted him to administer this examination with extra fairness and adhere strictly to the rules. She told him, ‘Too many nobles think they can get their friends’ children a pass into the Examination Hall with effusive recommendation letters. You must ensure that the results are just.’ ”

    </div>

- “I want fairness!” cried Théra. “The rules are unfair!”

    “What’s unfair about the rules? Everyone needs a pass—”

    “But I can’t get a pass no matter how hard I try!” Théra shouted. Phyro, who had never seen his clever, imperturbable sister in such a state, stared at Théra, his mouth agape.

    Gin waited.

- The inside of the Examination Hall was airy and open, as the interior was simply one large, high-ceilinged, circular room. Multiple rows of windows honeycombing the top half of the cylindrical wall and a massive, eyelike skylight in the center bathed the interior in sunlight. The floor was divided into concentric rings of stalls by eight-foot-tall partitions for the test takers, with a capacity close to two thousand. At the center of the hall was a tall pillar that raised a platform into the air, just below the ceiling, like the crow’s nest on a ship. The examination administrators sat on this platform, where they had a panoptic view of the proceedings to detect cheating. Halfway up the wall, above the test takers but below the administrators’ platform, was an elevated walkway that went all the way around the hall for the patrolling proctors, adding further security.

- The dreams of entire families hung on them: Nobles who had won their titles by the sword and horse hoped their descendants would add honor to those titles with the writing knife and brush; merchants who had amassed vast fortunes sought the cloak of respectability made possible only by a learned offspring in Imperial service; fathers who had failed in their own pursuit of glory desired to see those dreams redeemed by their sons; clans who hoped to leap out of obscurity pooled their resources to support a single, brilliant child. Many had paid expensive tutors who claimed to know the secret of writing the perfect essay, and even more had paid charlatans who sold crib sheets and cram notes that were as expensive as they were useless.

- The proctors noted each such instance of rule bending and came to consult with Rin and Cogo.

    “I don’t think these count as cheating,” mused a frowning Cogo. “At least I don’t think the rules explicitly prohibit such acts.”

    “We should give them a break,” said Rin magnanimously. “I’m pretty sure Kuni would be impressed by some of these tricks.”

- Year after year, no matter how much money the emperor paid to the men with glinting eyes and whispered promises, no matter what exotic exercises, diets, or prayers the emperor engaged in, he grew older and more sickly, and even killing the lying scoundrels seemed not to improve things one iota.

- Prince Pulo waited by the coast. He had given up hope of seeing his little brother again, and he was just waiting for wreckage to be washed ashore. But none of the flotsam that showed up on the beach seemed to be from the fleet.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- But Emperor Mapidéré had a different interpretation of the omen. Kiji and Tazu had broken up the fleet and devoured the pieces until there were no signs of the ships ever having existed. This was surely the gods’ way of informing him that he had been duped again.

- _Some subjects of the vegetable and animal kingdoms sought to accomplish their mission on their own: Sleek whales, largest among fish, raced around the islands to explore every hidden cove and visit every pristine beach before the others; golden chrysanthemums bloomed everywhere and saturated the air with their fragrance, hoping to entice a beauty-loving god or goddess out of concealment; clever ravens swooped over the cities of mankind, their eyes alert for anything that seemed divine rather than mortal; coconuts dropped into the ocean one after another, splashing out novel and pleasing tunes that they hoped might move a listening god to yield an exclamation of delight; golden and red carp danced through the ponds and rivers in scintillating formations, brandishing their diaphanous fins and waving their whiskers to mesmerize and delight the immortals; the lotus turned its thousand-eyed seedpods to every direction in the air and bared the hundreds of openings in its roots to listen for minute tremors underwater, a miniature all-seeing-all-hearing spy tower in operation; rabbits and deer raced across meadows on Écofi and Crescent Islands, each intent upon finding the unusual hump in the sea of grass that might be a god in disguise—unaware that the grasses were also plotting to weave false hiding places to divert the silly herbivores while they themselves sought the gods underground with their sensitive roots._

- _Water dripped from the stalactites high overhead, and other than clumps of mushroom glowing here and there like faint stars in the night sky, there was no illumination in the cave. The blind god sat by himself, unmoving and mute._

- _The smell grew stronger—a night-blooming orchid, he decided, and in his mind arose the image of a white flower with a large labellum like a rolled-up tongue that hid the stiff column in the middle, and four translucent petals that stood above the labellum like the translucent wings of a moth. He moved yet closer to the source of the smell, and as the diaphanous wings brushed his nose, he stuck out his tongue and traced the shapes of the petals. Yes, it was indeed the night-blooming orchid, whose shape was a faint echo of the moth that was said to be its sole pollinator, which emerged only in darkness and under starlight. It was a simple flower that was little valued by the ladies and gardeners, who preferred something more showy and ornate._

- _And Fithowéo stood up and ululated. As his voice filled the cave walls and bounced back to his ears, he seemed to see the stalactites hanging overhead like bejeweled curtains, the stalagmites growing out of the ground like bamboo shoots, the bats careening through the air like battle kites, the night-blooming orchids and cave roses blooming like living treasure—the cave was filled with light._

- _And Fithowéo continued to ululate, letting his throat and ears be his eyes, until he strode out of the cave, emerged into the sunlight, and picked up two pieces of darkest obsidian and placed them in his eye sockets so that he had eyes again. Though they were blind to light, they sowed fear into all who gazed into them.
And that was how the humble orchid joined the Calendrical Dozen._

- King Kuni rebelled against the Hegemon. Once again, the men (and women also, this time) of Dasu left the fields and fishing boats to die in distant lands. Aki wasn’t surprised. The dreams of the great lords of the world were built upon the blood and bones of the common people. The blossoming of the golden chrysanthemum required the fertilizer made from the ashes of the Hundred Flowers. That was an eternal truth.

    Peace did not come again until Mimi had turned thirteen, when King Kuni became Emperor Ragin, initiating the Reign of Four Placid Seas.

- “Whitefish doesn’t get any heavier over time. It was a story made up by unscrupulous merchants who blew air into the bellies of their fish to make them seem bigger. And when their fish turned out to weigh less than other fish of the same size, they argued that their catch was fresher, which was why they weighed less.”

- Luan frowned. Rin might have made it seem like a joke, but there was a hint of insecure bitterness to his comparison. He was looking for reassurance from Gin.

    “How about we hear from Luan next?” said Gin, interrupting his reverie.

    “Hmmm.” Luan stroked his chin thoughtfully. “I think I’m the pelagic anemone. I drift over the sea, riding on waves and drinking wind. All I need is a bit of sunlight, and I need not compete with the Hundred Flowers in color or fragrance.”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

- “Actually, there is something. . . . I think you’ve found a new puzzle to solve.”

    Luan was only slightly surprised. Risana’s talent was to intuit what people really desired, though it didn’t work on everyone. “I have indeed found something that occupies my mind.”

- “Weren’t some of Jia’s ladies-in-waiting young girls she had rescued from the streets of Çaruza during the time she was the Hegemon’s hostage?” asked Luan.

    “Indeed,” said Cogo. “Jia has been like a mother to them. They’re very resilient, resourceful, and—” He hesitated, searching for the right word.

    “—extraordinarily loyal to Jia,” said Luan. “Perhaps with more zeal than would make others comfortable.”

    Cogo chuckled. “The Imperial household is both harmonious and . . . not so.”

    Luan nodded. _It is very like Kuni to be comfortable with dissonant voices._

- The formality and order of the Imperial court was a far cry from the relaxed atmosphere that had prevailed at Kuni’s camp during the war years or the wild celebrations that had marked the empire’s early days, when Kuni’s followers had behaved more like friends than subordinates. As most of Kuni’s retinue had humble backgrounds, their uncouth manners often shocked the old nobles of the Seven States and those who had followed the Hegemon.

- Luan chortled. “I suppose that is one way of looking at it. What Gi Anji meant was that the stress the Moralists placed on cultivating virtue was misplaced. Most people are irredeemably selfish, and it is sufficient for the ruler to adjust the laws to encourage the right behavior. For example, if you increase taxes on farms but lower them for pastures—”

    </div>

- “What dialect are you speaking?” whispered Zomi as she scampered to sit next to Luan.

    “It’s the vernacular of Amu.”

    “It doesn’t sound like how the Amu merchants I’ve met in the markets talk—wait, is this how they talked thirty generations ago?”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- Luan nodded. “Since the zyndari letters simply represent the sounds of speech, I can no more read his writing than understand his speech if he wrote with letters. The Ano logograms, on the other hand, are not tied to the everyday speech of the people, but are frozen along with the departed language of the Ano, which we both know.”

    “So he’s writing the exact same way the first Ano did?” Zomi felt awed at the prospect of seeing someone writing in the same manner as ghosts of people dead for millennia. It seemed like a kind of magic.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: mellennium: millennia

    </div>

- “What does that first logogram you wrote say?” whispered Zomi.

    “What does it look like?” asked Luan, taking a sip from his teacup. “Oh, this plum-morning-orchid infusion is wonderful. I’ve missed it.”

    The logogram was simple: a squat cone with three peaks poking up at the top. “A small mountain?” said Zomi, her voice betraying some trepidation.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: trepidation: trepidation

    </div>

- Luan laughed, shaking his head. “You truly are hungry for knowledge. All right, think of each Ano logogram as a small machine, made up from components with distinct effects. The scallop shell is a semantic root, which designates the overall semantic domain of the logogram. Since the ancient Ano used shells as their first currency, the scallop shell references all things having to do with trade, finance, and wealth. There are hundreds of these semantic roots that you must learn to master the logograms.”

- One by one, the other pana méji were introduced, and they presented their ideas with various degrees of panache. Some put on skits like Kita Thu; some unveiled models or illustrations. One had his servants run around the Grand Audience Hall trying to fly some kites that were supposed to illustrate the elevated tone of his arguments—the lines got tangled and the kites crashed into the balconies, leading to much embarrassment and jokes about the “tangled skein” of his logic. Another chose to engage the Lords of Dara by making them participants in a mini-opera where they’d sing the chorus—that experiment fared about as well as one might expect.

- “I think the farmers and miners who labor for their food will be very surprised to hear that you claim to be the purpose of their life.” The empress did not relent. “Emperor Ragin had settled veterans from the rebellion and the Chrysanthemum-Dandelion War on small plots of land in the hope that they would become self-sufficient farmers leading stable lives. But unscrupulous merchants bought up these plots with promises of quick pay—which many of the veterans quickly frittered away in gambling parlors—and now the former landowners have to scrape for a living as tenant farmers or laborers. Raising the taxes on trade was a way to stop this trend.”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: unscrupulous: unscrupulous

    </div>

- Empress Jia ignored this side exchange. “Your arguments dance from Fluxism to Incentivism, and then to Patternism. Yet at its heart, trade is exploitation. When the harvest is good in Géfica, you lower the prices you offer so that the farmers barely make more than they do in other years; when locusts strike Tunoa, you raise the prices you demand so that families must choose between going into debt or starvation. The very word ‘trade’ is a misnomer—you prey upon misery! Why is it that the farmers of Cocru who till the fields still go hungry while the merchants of Gan dress in silk and eat meat at every meal?”

- Gin Mazoti looked at him, amused. Back when Zato Ruthi had been the King of Rima, he had repeatedly declared his disapproval of Kuni Garu’s choice of a woman as the Marshal of Dasu, citing Moralist adages about the proper relation between the sexes. However, after the emperor made it clear that he intended to open up the examinations to women and that as Imperial Tutor, he was to teach all the princes and princesses the same curriculum, he had managed to discover new support in Kon Fiji’s writings that suggested at least highborn women were _sometimes_ suitable for scholarship. Ancient texts were apparently as malleable in the hands of a master scholar as lumps of warm wax, able to bear any construction.

- “We offered to buy her a formal dress for today,” said one of them in a trembling voice, “but she refused.”

    “A piece of jade wrapped in a dust rag remains a piece of jade,” said Zomi. “But dog turds wrapped in silk will still stink up the room.”

    After a stunned moment of silence, Consort Risana’s laughter rang out in the Grand Audience Hall. The other pana méji, finally realizing that they had been insulted, turned to stare at Zomi angrily.

- Zomi thought of her own long walks along the beach and the days she spent wandering through the fields and woods of home, noting the patterns of racing clouds and blooming flowers and murmuring winds, hoping to understand the voices of the gods—yes, odd as her teacher was, Luan was a kindred spirit.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- Zomi pondered this. “But there is no soul to such performances. All that everyone would be doing is acting out roles dictated by Kon Fiji. It wouldn’t be real honor or mercy or charity if all the king is doing is following rules.”

    “The One True Sage would say that just as intent drives action, action can also drive intent. By acting morally, one becomes moral.”

- Zomi looked down and realized that her left leg was supporting her weight. Incredulous, she gingerly shifted her weight and tested her leg by flexing it. The complicated framework of supple branches and tough sinew flexed as well, lending her strength and support as though magnifying the movement of her atrophied muscles.

- “Some of these birds seemed similar to the birds the Ano knew in their homeland, and so they gave them the same names; others were new, and new words and logograms had to be invented. But see, all the names of the birds have the bird semantic root, and so even if you didn’t know what the logogram meant, you could guess that it was the name of a bird. This is one of the ways that the Ano logograms can give you hints about knowledge of the world. They are machines that transform the book of nature into models in our minds.”

- Growing worried, Luan wanted to stop and assess the situation, and he called out for Zomi to slow down. Still a bit uncoordinated, she stumbled ahead on her brace but refused to heed Luan’s admonitions. Luan had no choice but to rush to follow behind.

- Luan plucked some of the berries and found them to have a hard finish, almost like lacquered beads. The flowers exuded a strong fragrance that was spicy and smoky, as though the plants were burning. The smell from the berries was fainter, but still strong. The entire plant was like a miniature flame.
