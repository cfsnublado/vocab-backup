- As he chanted, the storyteller banged a coconut husk against a large kitchen spoon to simulate the sounds of sword clanging against shield; he leapt about, whipping his long sleeves this way and that to conjure the martial dance of legendary heroes in the flickering firelight of the pub. As his voice rose and fell, urgent one moment, languorous the next, the audience was transported to another time and place.

- “This is just a story,” Théra said. “Fighting nonstop for nine days and nine nights—how can you believe that really happened? Think: The storyteller wasn’t there, how would he know what the Hegemon and Mocri said?” But seeing the disappointment on her little brother’s face, she softened her tone. “If you want to hear real stories about heroes, I’ll tell you later about the time Auntie Soto stopped the Hegemon from hurting Mother and us. I was only three then, but I remember it as though it happened yesterday.”

    Phyro’s eyes brightened and he was about to ask for more, but a rough voice broke in.

    “I’ve had just about enough of this ridiculous tale, you insolent fraud!”

- “How dare you fabricate such stories about that crook Mata Zyndu? He tried to thwart Emperor Ragin’s righteous march to the throne and caused much needless suffering and desolation. By praising the despicable tyrant Zyndu, you’re denigrating the victory of our wise emperor and casting aspersions upon the character of the Dandelion Throne. These are words of treason.”

- The wife smiled ingratiatingly. “How about a flask of plum wine on the house? If you and Tino drink together, I’m sure you’ll forget about this little misunderstanding.”

    “What makes you think I want to have a drink with him?” asked Tino the storyteller, whipping his sleeves contemptuously at Scarface.

- The shouting among the patrons died down, and even Tino lost his confident look. Although Scarface looked more like a highwayman than a government official, Duke Coda, who was in charge of Emperor Ragin’s spies, was said to run his department in collaboration with the seedier elements of Dara society. It wouldn’t be beyond him to rely on someone like Scarface. Even though no one in the pub had ever heard of a storyteller getting in trouble for an embellished tale about the Hegemon, Duke Coda’s duties did include ferreting out traitors and dissatisfied former nobles plotting against the emperor. No one wanted to risk challenging the emperor’s own trusted eyes.

- _Kiji, my brother, still so humorless after all these years. Like you, I’ve come to observe Kuni’s contest of intellects, a trial of sharp words and stalwart logograms. You have my sympathies for the tribulations of your studious young lady, but I assure you I had nothing to do with the man who ruined her day—doesn’t mean that I won’t have anything more to do with him, though, now that he’s gotten my interest. However, you’re acting so outraged that one wonders who’s the girl and who’s the patron god._

- On and on the boy and the man raced through the streets of Pan, careless of the astonished looks of the passersby. Solofi’s lungs burned as he panted in the icy air; his legs felt leaden as he stumbled and slipped through the snow. The boy, however, was sure-footed like a goat on the snowbound cliffs of Mount Rapa, and seemed to taunt him by staying just a step ahead, barely out of his grasp. Several times he decided to stop and give up the chase, but each time, as he did so, the boy turned and lobbed another snowball at him. Solofi could not understand how the boy had so much strength and endurance—it seemed unnatural—but rage had driven reason from his mind, and all he could think of was the pleasure he would feel when he crushed the skull of that nasty urchin against some wall.

- “Very good, Suadégo. The spirits are pleased with your progress. Tomorrow you can dance in the second line. Don’t you feel all energized? Ah, these are the new envelopes . . . let me count how many blessed faith tokens you and your recruits have sold . . . only two new recruits from this past week? I’m disappointed! You and your husband need to talk to everyone in the family—cousins, second cousins, their children and the children’s spouses, and their cousins—everyone! Remember, your faith is evinced by the size of your contribution, and the more people you recruit to spread the faith, the more pleased the spirits will be! Here’s your prize—it’s a negotiation pill. Hold it under your tongue before you have to talk to a supplier and visualize success, you understand? You must believe or it won’t work!”

- During the Chrysanthemum-Dandelion War, Noda and Doru tumbled from their thrones before the might of Gin Mazoti’s army and were cast out of the Hegemon’s favor. They had then drifted around the Islands as fugitives in subsequent years, making a living as bandits, highwaymen, merchants of rotten meat and spoiled fish, kidnappers, scammers . . . while hiding from Emperor Ragin’s constables.

- Noda waved his hand to indicate that he had smoked enough. Instead, he took a sip from a flask, letting the throat-burning liquor warm him against the bitter cold. “You’ve certainly put your impressive muscles to good use. That trick with the teahouse storytellers is pretty good. Thanks for sharing the tip; I’ll have to give it a try.”

    “It wouldn’t work for you. They wouldn’t be scared enough,” said Solofi, looking contemptuously at Noda’s thin, small figure. “But your pyramid scheme isn’t bad either. How were you able to convince so many fools to dance for you and give you money?”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: contemptous: contemptously

    </div>

-  “Oh, believe it. Never underestimate the power of the need to appear better than their peers to motivate people, a tendency that I’m happy to indulge. I set up little competitions, promoting dancers from the back to the front if they appear more faithful and demoting them if they’re not as enthusiastic. I give them prizes based on how fervently they gyrate and strut. I tell them that they’re ready to be spiritual teachers on their own, and have them go out to recruit their own magic dance students—and, of course, I collect a portion of the tuition they get. Nothing convinces a fool to believe in a scam better than turning him into a scammer too. I do believe that I could show up naked one of these days and tell them that only the devout can see my spiritual outfit; they would outdo each other in describing the glory of my raiment.”

    At this, Solofi’s eyes dimmed momentarily. “Once we did dress in the finest water silk embroidered in gold, you and I.”

    “We did,” agreed Noda, his tone equally somber. But then his eyes brightened as he examined Solofi. “Perhaps we can again.”

- “There are others who think like you and me—disgraced nobles, the Hegemon’s veterans, scholars who failed to place in the examinations, merchants who can’t make as much profit as they like by cheating at taxes. . . . Dara may be a land at peace, but the hearts of men are never peaceful. I have learned much about fanning the flames of dissatisfaction, and you have a figure that is meant to ride at the head of a crowd. The gods meant for us to meet here today, and we can reclaim the glory that is our due from the weed-emperor. Remember, he was once no better than we.”

- “Fara is four! I’m sure the others would have taken her if they didn’t think she’d get in the way of whatever mischief they were planning. And they had the audacity to have their servants rustling paper in their rooms so that if I walked by I’d think they were working!”

    “Of course such childish tricks would not be effective against a perspicacious teacher such as—”

    “That is not the point! Empress, you know that I have tried my best to teach the children, but even the most patient man has limits. Running away from their punishment essays was bad enough, but look at this. Look!” He dropped the satchel from his shoulder and twisted around to show the empress the back of his robe.

    In childish zyndari letters, a couplet was painted on the fabric:

    _I play the zither for the ruminating cow,_

    _The cow speaks: Moo-moo-moo-moo, why such knitted brow?_

- Ruthi glared at them. “Do you think it’s funny to be compared to the foolish man in Lurusén’s poem who played the zither for cows and then complained about not being understood? No wonder learning has such a hard time taking root in such thin soil.” Empress Jia’s retinue blanched and looked away.

- Ada-_tika_, whose formal name was Princess Fara, was Kuni’s youngest daughter. As her mother, Consort Fina, had died early, all the other children tried to be extra solicitous of her.

- Gin had always liked Phyro the most of all of Kuni’s children. This was only in part because Phyro was bright and always begged her for stories about the war. In truth, Gin had a better rapport with Consort Risana than Kuni’s other wives. During the time of Kuni’s rise, Jia was held by the Hegemon as a hostage while Risana rode by Kuni’s side, and Gin had come to respect her as an adviser to the king. Secretly, she hoped that Kuni would designate Phyro the crown prince.

- “I heard the empress tell Prime Minister Yelu that she wanted him to administer this examination with extra fairness and adhere strictly to the rules. She told him, ‘Too many nobles think they can get their friends’ children a pass into the Examination Hall with effusive recommendation letters. You must ensure that the results are just.’ ”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- “I want fairness!” cried Théra. “The rules are unfair!”

    “What’s unfair about the rules? Everyone needs a pass—”

    “But I can’t get a pass no matter how hard I try!” Théra shouted. Phyro, who had never seen his clever, imperturbable sister in such a state, stared at Théra, his mouth agape.

    Gin waited.

- The inside of the Examination Hall was airy and open, as the interior was simply one large, high-ceilinged, circular room. Multiple rows of windows honeycombing the top half of the cylindrical wall and a massive, eyelike skylight in the center bathed the interior in sunlight. The floor was divided into concentric rings of stalls by eight-foot-tall partitions for the test takers, with a capacity close to two thousand. At the center of the hall was a tall pillar that raised a platform into the air, just below the ceiling, like the crow’s nest on a ship. The examination administrators sat on this platform, where they had a panoptic view of the proceedings to detect cheating. Halfway up the wall, above the test takers but below the administrators’ platform, was an elevated walkway that went all the way around the hall for the patrolling proctors, adding further security.

- The dreams of entire families hung on them: Nobles who had won their titles by the sword and horse hoped their descendants would add honor to those titles with the writing knife and brush; merchants who had amassed vast fortunes sought the cloak of respectability made possible only by a learned offspring in Imperial service; fathers who had failed in their own pursuit of glory desired to see those dreams redeemed by their sons; clans who hoped to leap out of obscurity pooled their resources to support a single, brilliant child. Many had paid expensive tutors who claimed to know the secret of writing the perfect essay, and even more had paid charlatans who sold crib sheets and cram notes that were as expensive as they were useless.

- The proctors noted each such instance of rule bending and came to consult with Rin and Cogo.

    “I don’t think these count as cheating,” mused a frowning Cogo. “At least I don’t think the rules explicitly prohibit such acts.”

    “We should give them a break,” said Rin magnanimously. “I’m pretty sure Kuni would be impressed by some of these tricks.”

- Year after year, no matter how much money the emperor paid to the men with glinting eyes and whispered promises, no matter what exotic exercises, diets, or prayers the emperor engaged in, he grew older and more sickly, and even killing the lying scoundrels seemed not to improve things one iota.

- Prince Pulo waited by the coast. He had given up hope of seeing his little brother again, and he was just waiting for wreckage to be washed ashore. But none of the flotsam that showed up on the beach seemed to be from the fleet.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- But Emperor Mapidéré had a different interpretation of the omen. Kiji and Tazu had broken up the fleet and devoured the pieces until there were no signs of the ships ever having existed. This was surely the gods’ way of informing him that he had been duped again.

- _Some subjects of the vegetable and animal kingdoms sought to accomplish their mission on their own: Sleek whales, largest among fish, raced around the islands to explore every hidden cove and visit every pristine beach before the others; golden chrysanthemums bloomed everywhere and saturated the air with their fragrance, hoping to entice a beauty-loving god or goddess out of concealment; clever ravens swooped over the cities of mankind, their eyes alert for anything that seemed divine rather than mortal; coconuts dropped into the ocean one after another, splashing out novel and pleasing tunes that they hoped might move a listening god to yield an exclamation of delight; golden and red carp danced through the ponds and rivers in scintillating formations, brandishing their diaphanous fins and waving their whiskers to mesmerize and delight the immortals; the lotus turned its thousand-eyed seedpods to every direction in the air and bared the hundreds of openings in its roots to listen for minute tremors underwater, a miniature all-seeing-all-hearing spy tower in operation; rabbits and deer raced across meadows on Écofi and Crescent Islands, each intent upon finding the unusual hump in the sea of grass that might be a god in disguise—unaware that the grasses were also plotting to weave false hiding places to divert the silly herbivores while they themselves sought the gods underground with their sensitive roots._

- _Water dripped from the stalactites high overhead, and other than clumps of mushroom glowing here and there like faint stars in the night sky, there was no illumination in the cave. The blind god sat by himself, unmoving and mute._

- _The smell grew stronger—a night-blooming orchid, he decided, and in his mind arose the image of a white flower with a large labellum like a rolled-up tongue that hid the stiff column in the middle, and four translucent petals that stood above the labellum like the translucent wings of a moth. He moved yet closer to the source of the smell, and as the diaphanous wings brushed his nose, he stuck out his tongue and traced the shapes of the petals. Yes, it was indeed the night-blooming orchid, whose shape was a faint echo of the moth that was said to be its sole pollinator, which emerged only in darkness and under starlight. It was a simple flower that was little valued by the ladies and gardeners, who preferred something more showy and ornate._

- _And Fithowéo stood up and ululated. As his voice filled the cave walls and bounced back to his ears, he seemed to see the stalactites hanging overhead like bejeweled curtains, the stalagmites growing out of the ground like bamboo shoots, the bats careening through the air like battle kites, the night-blooming orchids and cave roses blooming like living treasure—the cave was filled with light._

- _And Fithowéo continued to ululate, letting his throat and ears be his eyes, until he strode out of the cave, emerged into the sunlight, and picked up two pieces of darkest obsidian and placed them in his eye sockets so that he had eyes again. Though they were blind to light, they sowed fear into all who gazed into them.
And that was how the humble orchid joined the Calendrical Dozen._

- King Kuni rebelled against the Hegemon. Once again, the men (and women also, this time) of Dasu left the fields and fishing boats to die in distant lands. Aki wasn’t surprised. The dreams of the great lords of the world were built upon the blood and bones of the common people. The blossoming of the golden chrysanthemum required the fertilizer made from the ashes of the Hundred Flowers. That was an eternal truth.

    Peace did not come again until Mimi had turned thirteen, when King Kuni became Emperor Ragin, initiating the Reign of Four Placid Seas.

- “Whitefish doesn’t get any heavier over time. It was a story made up by unscrupulous merchants who blew air into the bellies of their fish to make them seem bigger. And when their fish turned out to weigh less than other fish of the same size, they argued that their catch was fresher, which was why they weighed less.”

- Luan frowned. Rin might have made it seem like a joke, but there was a hint of insecure bitterness to his comparison. He was looking for reassurance from Gin.

    “How about we hear from Luan next?” said Gin, interrupting his reverie.

    “Hmmm.” Luan stroked his chin thoughtfully. “I think I’m the pelagic anemone. I drift over the sea, riding on waves and drinking wind. All I need is a bit of sunlight, and I need not compete with the Hundred Flowers in color or fragrance.”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

- “Actually, there is something. . . . I think you’ve found a new puzzle to solve.”

    Luan was only slightly surprised. Risana’s talent was to intuit what people really desired, though it didn’t work on everyone. “I have indeed found something that occupies my mind.”

- “Weren’t some of Jia’s ladies-in-waiting young girls she had rescued from the streets of Çaruza during the time she was the Hegemon’s hostage?” asked Luan.

    “Indeed,” said Cogo. “Jia has been like a mother to them. They’re very resilient, resourceful, and—” He hesitated, searching for the right word.

    “—extraordinarily loyal to Jia,” said Luan. “Perhaps with more zeal than would make others comfortable.”

    Cogo chuckled. “The Imperial household is both harmonious and . . . not so.”

    Luan nodded. _It is very like Kuni to be comfortable with dissonant voices._

- The formality and order of the Imperial court was a far cry from the relaxed atmosphere that had prevailed at Kuni’s camp during the war years or the wild celebrations that had marked the empire’s early days, when Kuni’s followers had behaved more like friends than subordinates. As most of Kuni’s retinue had humble backgrounds, their uncouth manners often shocked the old nobles of the Seven States and those who had followed the Hegemon.

- Luan chortled. “I suppose that is one way of looking at it. What Gi Anji meant was that the stress the Moralists placed on cultivating virtue was misplaced. Most people are irredeemably selfish, and it is sufficient for the ruler to adjust the laws to encourage the right behavior. For example, if you increase taxes on farms but lower them for pastures—”

    </div>

- “What dialect are you speaking?” whispered Zomi as she scampered to sit next to Luan.

    “It’s the vernacular of Amu.”

    “It doesn’t sound like how the Amu merchants I’ve met in the markets talk—wait, is this how they talked thirty generations ago?”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- Luan nodded. “Since the zyndari letters simply represent the sounds of speech, I can no more read his writing than understand his speech if he wrote with letters. The Ano logograms, on the other hand, are not tied to the everyday speech of the people, but are frozen along with the departed language of the Ano, which we both know.”

    “So he’s writing the exact same way the first Ano did?” Zomi felt awed at the prospect of seeing someone writing in the same manner as ghosts of people dead for millennia. It seemed like a kind of magic.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: mellennium: millennia

    </div>

- “What does that first logogram you wrote say?” whispered Zomi.

    “What does it look like?” asked Luan, taking a sip from his teacup. “Oh, this plum-morning-orchid infusion is wonderful. I’ve missed it.”

    The logogram was simple: a squat cone with three peaks poking up at the top. “A small mountain?” said Zomi, her voice betraying some trepidation.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: trepidation: trepidation

    </div>

- Luan laughed, shaking his head. “You truly are hungry for knowledge. All right, think of each Ano logogram as a small machine, made up from components with distinct effects. The scallop shell is a semantic root, which designates the overall semantic domain of the logogram. Since the ancient Ano used shells as their first currency, the scallop shell references all things having to do with trade, finance, and wealth. There are hundreds of these semantic roots that you must learn to master the logograms.”

- One by one, the other pana méji were introduced, and they presented their ideas with various degrees of panache. Some put on skits like Kita Thu; some unveiled models or illustrations. One had his servants run around the Grand Audience Hall trying to fly some kites that were supposed to illustrate the elevated tone of his arguments—the lines got tangled and the kites crashed into the balconies, leading to much embarrassment and jokes about the “tangled skein” of his logic. Another chose to engage the Lords of Dara by making them participants in a mini-opera where they’d sing the chorus—that experiment fared about as well as one might expect.

- “I think the farmers and miners who labor for their food will be very surprised to hear that you claim to be the purpose of their life.” The empress did not relent. “Emperor Ragin had settled veterans from the rebellion and the Chrysanthemum-Dandelion War on small plots of land in the hope that they would become self-sufficient farmers leading stable lives. But unscrupulous merchants bought up these plots with promises of quick pay—which many of the veterans quickly frittered away in gambling parlors—and now the former landowners have to scrape for a living as tenant farmers or laborers. Raising the taxes on trade was a way to stop this trend.”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: unscrupulous: unscrupulous

    </div>

- Empress Jia ignored this side exchange. “Your arguments dance from Fluxism to Incentivism, and then to Patternism. Yet at its heart, trade is exploitation. When the harvest is good in Géfica, you lower the prices you offer so that the farmers barely make more than they do in other years; when locusts strike Tunoa, you raise the prices you demand so that families must choose between going into debt or starvation. The very word ‘trade’ is a misnomer—you prey upon misery! Why is it that the farmers of Cocru who till the fields still go hungry while the merchants of Gan dress in silk and eat meat at every meal?”

- Gin Mazoti looked at him, amused. Back when Zato Ruthi had been the King of Rima, he had repeatedly declared his disapproval of Kuni Garu’s choice of a woman as the Marshal of Dasu, citing Moralist adages about the proper relation between the sexes. However, after the emperor made it clear that he intended to open up the examinations to women and that as Imperial Tutor, he was to teach all the princes and princesses the same curriculum, he had managed to discover new support in Kon Fiji’s writings that suggested at least highborn women were _sometimes_ suitable for scholarship. Ancient texts were apparently as malleable in the hands of a master scholar as lumps of warm wax, able to bear any construction.

- “We offered to buy her a formal dress for today,” said one of them in a trembling voice, “but she refused.”

    “A piece of jade wrapped in a dust rag remains a piece of jade,” said Zomi. “But dog turds wrapped in silk will still stink up the room.”

    After a stunned moment of silence, Consort Risana’s laughter rang out in the Grand Audience Hall. The other pana méji, finally realizing that they had been insulted, turned to stare at Zomi angrily.

- Zomi thought of her own long walks along the beach and the days she spent wandering through the fields and woods of home, noting the patterns of racing clouds and blooming flowers and murmuring winds, hoping to understand the voices of the gods—yes, odd as her teacher was, Luan was a kindred spirit.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- Zomi pondered this. “But there is no soul to such performances. All that everyone would be doing is acting out roles dictated by Kon Fiji. It wouldn’t be real honor or mercy or charity if all the king is doing is following rules.”

    “The One True Sage would say that just as intent drives action, action can also drive intent. By acting morally, one becomes moral.”

- Zomi looked down and realized that her left leg was supporting her weight. Incredulous, she gingerly shifted her weight and tested her leg by flexing it. The complicated framework of supple branches and tough sinew flexed as well, lending her strength and support as though magnifying the movement of her atrophied muscles.

- “Some of these birds seemed similar to the birds the Ano knew in their homeland, and so they gave them the same names; others were new, and new words and logograms had to be invented. But see, all the names of the birds have the bird semantic root, and so even if you didn’t know what the logogram meant, you could guess that it was the name of a bird. This is one of the ways that the Ano logograms can give you hints about knowledge of the world. They are machines that transform the book of nature into models in our minds.”

- Growing worried, Luan wanted to stop and assess the situation, and he called out for Zomi to slow down. Still a bit uncoordinated, she stumbled ahead on her brace but refused to heed Luan’s admonitions. Luan had no choice but to rush to follow behind.

- Luan plucked some of the berries and found them to have a hard finish, almost like lacquered beads. The flowers exuded a strong fragrance that was spicy and smoky, as though the plants were burning. The smell from the berries was fainter, but still strong.

- Everyone stared at the young woman, stunned, but she gazed fearlessly at the emperor.

    “You—you—” Ruthi was shaking so much that he had trouble getting the words out. “Wh-what are you saying? This has nothing to do with your essay!”

    “My essay was merely a pastiche of your old ideas—the best way to please a judge is to regurgitate his own ideas back at him in new clothing—of course I won’t present that to the emperor.”

    Ruthi’s eyes bulged, as did the eyes of practically everyone else in the hall. This young woman was either beyond bold or insane.

- Ruthi slammed his ledger onto the floor and gesticulated wildly with his arms. He was beyond caring about decorum and appearances. “The emperor’s charge to me is to seek men—and women—of talent. I have faithfully carried out my duty. Your presence here is proof that the method is sound. Though you’re from a humble land of illiterate peasants, yet today the emperor and all the Lords of Dara have lent you their ears!”

- “What are you thinking?” Zomi’s guard was up. Luan’s tone was too strange.

    “Don’t argue! You’re the student. You must obey.”

    “I won’t obey an order that is wrong!”

    Luan laughed. “Now you sound like a Moralist. It was Kon Fiji himself who said that the duty to the Just and True supersedes all others, even a command from a teacher. I thought you didn’t like Kon Fiji.”

    “Even an idiot can be right sometimes.”

- The villagers rushed over. Without saying a word, Séji ripped open Luan’s leggings to reveal the sickening wound in his thigh. While she ripped strips from Luan’s robe to fashion a tourniquet to stop the bleeding, Képulu rummaged through her basket for leaves that she chewed into a poultice, applied it to the wound, and bandaged the leg.

    Meanwhile, the earl’s men maneuvered the screaming Zomi into the gondola. The four “cushions” shifted to make space so that she was directly under the dials and levers for controlling the balloon’s stove, and then they squeezed in and held her legs so that she was trapped next to the earl and his pile of boar trophies.

    “Let me go!” Zomi shouted. “I won’t fly the balloon for you.”

- Zomi stared at Luan in disbelief. She couldn’t understand why her teacher was choosing this moment to engage in another philosophy discussion. _And why is he just standing there?_

    “No matter what else you think of the Moralists, their core belief is right: Sometimes you must do the right thing even if it hurts you. Actions reify ideals. We must never stop striving to do good, to protect the weak and the powerless. This is the charge to all men of learning.”

    Zomi nodded, but she continued to stare at the stiff figure of Luan. Having dealt with a weak leg all her life, she was sensitive to the way people distributed their weight on their legs.

- “How dare”—but realizing that Zomi was necessary for them to get out of the maelstrom of scalding winds buffeting the balloon, the earl swallowed his curse—“you can’t possibly think a wild peasant’s life is worth more than one of my servants.”

- She learned to draft in the unique plain brushstrokes of Xana engineers, who combined zyndari letters with barely sketched flat projections of Ano logograms to create a script that eschewed the emotive qualities of language in favor of the precision and elegance of numbers. She learned the one thousand and one semantic roots, the fifty-one groups of motive modifiers, and all the phonetic adapters, inflection glyphs, and tone elevation techniques that allowed a scholar to wield the knife and the brush to marshal the Ano logograms into complicated idea-machines for purposes of persuasion, explication, exploration, and artistic pleasure.

We must have at least six cups of wine later; I dare say I have a much better liquor collection now, and I’m sorry we haven’t been able to spend much time together for your visit. While you’ve been away, my people have had a very difficult time keeping an eye on you—for protection!—for you’re like an elusive turtle in the ocean, popping up in some town for a few days and then disappearing for months!”

    Luan chuckled. “Thank you for your concern for my safety, but perhaps it’s best for our chief spy not to admit in front of the emperor that your employees have been having trouble keeping a simple itinerant scholar under surveillance.”

- Kuni struggled to get his laughter under control. “Ahem . . . Zomi Kidosu is right that the Imperial examinations, as fair as I’ve tried to make them, are not a good way to attract the talents of all of Dara. Though I’ve opened the examinations and the civil service to women, few have applied to take the examinations and even fewer have risen through the ranks. I have been asking Rin to find girls of promising talent and to secretly offer their parents a stipend to encourage them to attend school and take the tests—that is what I meant by the Golden Carp. But so far the results have been poor, even in Haan. Most parents do not want their daughters to leave home and seek a career in the service of the Imperial bureaucracy.”

- Kuni gave him a bitter smile. “We’re all young in the eyes of the gods and old in the eyes of our children. A young dynasty must pass through a wall of storms before the first succession—no less treacherous than the mythical walls in your ancient tomes. If we succeed, this empire might last as long as the Seven States; if we fail, my fate will be no different from that of Mapidéré. Jia and Risana both have been pushing, in their own ways, for me to name the crown prince. Who would you choose?”

- “Surely things are not as bad as that!”

    “No, perhaps not. But . . . so far you’ve been speaking of talents. What of a father’s heart?”

    Luan took a deep breath. “There is a natural affection between you and Prince Phyro, which is lamentably absent between you and Prince Timu.”

    Kuni winced but did not look away. “The gods keep an accounting of our errors and mistakes, and sooner or later we are asked to pay. I was absent from Timu’s life for much of his childhood, and things have always been awkward between us. But is it right to deprive the firstborn of his natural inheritance for choices he did not make?”

    “Guilt is not the best way to pick an heir.”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

- “If the young do not have radical ideas, the world will never change,” said Kuni—and Luan was reminded of the legend of a young Kuni Garu who had gazed upon the face of Mapidéré and saw his eventual downfall. “Each fresh wave coming to land from the sea is brash, bold, radical, and wild like a newborn idea; the wave is worn down by the unyielding reality of the hard land and eventually dissipates, exhausted, to be replaced by the next wave in an apparently futile endeavor. Yet the cumulative efforts of such successive surges, over generations and eons, carved the coastline of Dara. Like me, she will learn the art of the possible; I’m patient.”

    “Sometimes I think you’re a kite rider in time,” said Luan. “Your visions are so far beyond the horizon of the present.”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: cumulative: cumulative

    </div>

- “I have to be in control long enough to see the seeds I plant germinate and blossom—in some ways, the older I grow, the more I become sympathetic to Mapidéré, who also begged the gods for more time. So I keep myself in good health with Jia’s herbs that regulate the humors, and vigorous exercise.” Kuni picked up the buckets for another trip back to the stream. “As long as I can keep things from spilling over, I think I have a chance of preparing Dara to weather the wall of storms.”

    And so the emperor and his adviser continued to labor in the farm in the middle of the Imperial palace, nourishing an old friendship and new sprouts.

- “Ahem.” Kado cleared his throat awkwardly. “I can’t hide anything from you. Yes, I’m sorry, but such a thought did cross my mind. I should have been more circumspect, of course.”

    “So if you didn’t recommend her, how did she come to be in possession of a pass to the Examination Hall? Was it a forgery?”

    “I did do some discreet investigating afterward. She got in with a proper examination pass, but it wasn’t one signed by me.”

    “Who did sign it?”

    “Queen Gin of Géjira.”

    Jia looked thoughtful. Then she smiled and raised the cup again. “Thank you, brother. Thank you.”

- Eight years earlier, Mata Zyndu, the greatest warrior who had ever walked the Islands of Dara, had committed suicide along with his faithful consort, Lady Mira, after being betrayed by his erstwhile friend, Kuni Garu. When news arrived that the Hegemon had refused to cross the channel because he could not bear the shame of facing the people of his homeland, many had vowed to fight Kuni Garu to the bitter end to avenge their lord.

- Then the emperor announced that the Tunoa Isles would not be enfeoffed to a noble, but would remain directly under Imperial administration. To honor the man the emperor had once called brother, the people of Tunoa would not have to pay taxes for five years. The palace would buy all the dried fish it needed exclusively from Tunoa at guaranteed prices as well as offer positions in the palace for the women of Tunoa to work as Imperial embroiderers. Finally, Zyndu Castle would be renovated and turned into a mausoleum for the Hegemon, and the Imperial Treasury hinted at a large roster of local masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, and general laborers who would be employed.

- “The emperor agrees with me that adding more biography to our curriculum is a good idea,” said Zato Ruthi.

    A spring breeze wafted through the instruction hall, bringing with it the fragrance of early-blooming flowers.

    “As the sons and daughters of the emperor, it is my hope that the great deeds of important historical figures will inspire you to greater virtue and that the patterns of the past will warn you of pitfalls for the future. I want each of you to spend the next month focusing on a figure of your choice from the recent past. You will study that person’s life in detail and explain his rise and fall, connecting that experience with the broader patterns of history.

    “Fara, why don’t we begin with you? Who do you want to study?”

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    </div>

- “The Hegemon’s consort?” Ruthi pondered this request and then nodded approvingly. “Lady Mira tried to mitigate the Hegemon’s more volatile tendencies, and in the end she died to demonstrate her faith to her beloved husband. She was a paragon of virtuous womanhood, and a fit choice for a young lady to study. Now, Prince Timu, who is your favorite?”

- The memory of those more dangerous but also more carefree days made Otho’s heart throb with pain. He shook off the reminiscences and continued, “Rin Coda’s spies keep a close eye on shipping through the ports by merchants and large landowners as well as the bigger smuggling gangs, but they rarely pay attention to itinerant entertainers, especially the women. The actresses recommended by Lady Ragi were able to hide the funds and other goods in prop trunks and bring them into Tunoa without Duke Coda’s spies ever suspecting that anything was amiss—it also helped that the troupe had a letter of introduction from Lady Ragi’s husband.”

- “Of course he would,” said Kuni. “Standard lease terms will help curb the sort of abuses that Zomi Kidosu spoke of, and place the tax burden where it belongs. Getting the nobles to promulgate these models in their domains will be trickier, however. They’ll view it as more Imperial interference in their affairs.”

    To the side, Théra continued to plant sweet lantern seedlings. Her ears perked up and her hands slowed down at the mention of Zomi’s name.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

- “I have a solution for that,” said Risana. “When you issue the edict, you can couch it as a request for comments. That way, each of the nobles will be able to offer suggestions and adapt the model for conditions unique in each fief.”

    “Good,” said Kuni. “That way, they’ll feel consulted rather than imposed on.”

    “And I will write privately to the wives of the most recalcitrant lords. I know what most of them are really afraid of, and by assuring the wives that this policy has nothing to do with the empress, they’ll pass the sentiment on to their husbands.”

- “When you try something repeatedly and it doesn’t work, continuing along the same path would be madness.”
Soto took a deep breath. “I’ll always be loyal to you, Jia. But I have affection for all the children. I don’t like to see any of them hurt.”

- “Like the Hegemon, Kuni places too much faith in personal trust. During the Chrysanthemum-Dandelion War, he allowed Gin Mazoti to declare herself queen, gambling that the gesture of trust would buy her loyalty. He allows each of his nobles to keep an army large enough to bring ruin upon the land, though the Islands are at peace. Like the man he once called brother, Kuni has decided to build his empire upon bonds of trust between him and those who serve him.”

    “And why is that wrong?”

    “Because trust is fickle and will not bear a heavy load. Kuni has made the empire dependent on him because he thinks only he can see a path forward. That is a fragile state. Phyro, though he is young, shows the same tendencies.”

- Looking at her happy brothers, Théra felt the pangs of another bout of envy. They were going to go into the wide world and experience life. Still mere boys, they would make decisions that changed the lives of the people—albeit with some supervision and advice from Zato Ruthi and Rin Coda. They were starting down the path to a life of accomplishment, of judgment and rule. She, on the other hand, was going to be cooped up in the palace, preparing for the only future that she could see: a marriage to some mysterious man.

    But she was assuaged by the thought that she had taken a small step to change that future.

- _Sorry I haven’t written in so long. It’s not much of an excuse, but I’ve been busy because work is going very well. I’m given a lot of responsibility, and the queen, I think, trusts me more with each passing day. Right now I’m working on a pet project whereby I try to teach the daughters of the farming families of Géjira the zyndari letters and have them read the Ano Classics in vernacular translation, without forcing them to learn the Ano logograms. They love it! There is so much beauty in Classical Ano literature, but so few get to enjoy it because they cannot read the logograms. Already the girls are writing beautiful stories full of Classical Ano allusions—and other than the fact that they’re in vernacular translation, I think they’re better than the stories written by the boys their age in the private academies._

- Jia jabbed Kuni in the ribs.

    “Aw! Ahem! Excellent reading, excellent!” Somewhat disoriented, Kuni shouted at the mostly empty private audience hall.

    “I was doing the reading,” said Jia, “not some scribe. Did you really fall asleep?”

    “Asleep? No! I was merely resting my eyes.”

    “How could you!”

    “Jia, you can’t possibly blame me for this! Timu’s letters have gotten more and more tedious over time. He has always tended to pleonasm, but I’m afraid his prose has grown as out of control as the weeds at the edge of my garden.”

    “Prince Timu’s style is . . . ornate,” said Risana.

    “He takes ten sentences to say what could be said in one, which is to say, what others may—oh, look, he’s even gotten me to do it!”

- _Pursuant to my decision early on to outlaw all private worship of Mata Zyndu and to direct all who wished to honor the Hegemon to the mausoleum in Farun, Duke Coda has been leading the effort to crack down on the troublemakers. You and I both have commended the speed with which he uncovered these nests of poisonous snakes and captured their leaders—sometimes it seemed as if he had a preternatural sense for where they would be found, as befitting the reputation of the Imperial Farsight Secretary._

- _Rumors that Mi and Solofi could converse with the spirit of the Hegemon could be heard on every street corner, and we finally tracked down their source when we captured about a dozen mirrors endowed with strange magic. Although they seem plain enough, when placed in the sun, they project an image of the Hegemon in a supernatural manner. Duke Coda and I have studied these mirrors in depth, consulting expert mirror makers and scholars, even destroying a few of them in the process, but none could discover their secret. Noda Mi and Doru Solofi are now in open rebellion, and more foolish men and women rally to their cause daily, inspired by the belief that they have the aid of the dauntless spirit of Mata Zyndu._

- Kimo took a deep breath and started in on the speech Cano Tho had written for him. “Lord Garu and I were once coequal lords of Dara, dedicated to the ideal of overthrowing the despotism of Xana.”

    Kuni’s face didn’t change at Théca’s addressing him as “Lord Garu.” That was to be expected.

    <div markdown="1" class="tagged-entries">

    en: despotism: despotism

    </div>

- Kimo went on. “Yet even so, Lord Garu appears dissatisfied. Over time, your decrees have evinced the intent to weaken the enfeoffed nobles and strip them of their arms and land. It does not seem that Lord Garu would stop until all of Dara is under a single fist. For the sake of my heirs and those who have followed me, I demand justice from Lord Garu.”

- Théra blushed at having her intent seen through so clearly. But the man continued amiably, “My name isn’t very important. I’m just an old smith who happens to have an interest in music. Do not blame the guards—I come and go as I please, and I play music for an audience in whom I have great hopes. We’re all in search of the one true friend who can understand the voice in your heart when you play a hesitant tune on the moaphya.”

- The familiarity of the man’s last sentence made Théra relax. Whoever this man was, she felt that she coul343d trust him. “If master will not share his name, I won’t press. You call this a moaphya? I’ve never seen one before.”

    “It’s an old Ano instrument, rarely seen after the Diaspora Wars,” said the man. “The name means ‘square sound.’ You can spot mentions of it in the old heroic sagas. The hero Iluthan was a skilled player.” He beckoned at Fara. “Would you like to try it?”

    While Fara enthusiastically banged on the slabs without much skill, Théra asked, “Can you tell me more about it?”

- _You must weigh the fish._ Théra remembered the colorful phrase from Zomi Kidosu’s Palace Examination performance. _The Prophecy of the Fish had been a trick; why should the “magic mirrors” be any different?_

    Théra threw herself into her task with abandon. Never before had she been given such a complex, intricate puzzle to solve, and she found joy in facing off against such a foe. Perhaps, she thought, _this is something like the battle lust that the Hegemon always spoke of and Hudo-tika always yearned for. There is a pleasure in dedicating yourself to overcoming overwhelming odds, in bringing all your strength to bear against the unknown._

- Doru Solofi had to keep himself from laughing as he listened to Noda’s bombast. He and Noda had hardly thought to endow the date of their discovery of the mirrors with such significance until much later, of course, but he supposed that if he squinted really hard, what Noda Mi was saying wasn’t exactly a lie. The prostitute from whom Noda had stolen the money purse with the first magic mirror was indeed dark-haired, and the girl he had been with that night had been a blonde. They certainly had been billed by the indigo house as of “goddess” quality. Anyway, as Noda Mi always said, “The grace of kings lies in graceful lies,” which he claimed to be a palindrome when written out in Ano logograms.

- “You dare to desecrate the image of the Hegemon?” asked Phyro. He leaned the portrait over the edge of the wall. “This was one of Lady Mira’s famous embroideries and captured the very essence of the Hegemon’s spirit.

- Gin Mazoti had never shied away from letting her daughter know how she came by her throne, and Zomi was used to the way the princess spoke easily of killing and warfare. In truth, since her arrival in Géjira, she had been working to moderate some of Gin’s more militaristic instincts to administer the realm with a gentler hand. For instance, she had encouraged Gin to freeze the military budget and divert more funds into building village schools for the poor modeled on the learning huts of old Haan. She was using them to experiment with a new curriculum that emphasized writing in the vernacular and practical skills like mental arithmetic and geometry that eschewed proofs. Gin had been far more amenable to her suggestions than the Imperial bureaucracy, and Zomi felt that she was finally finding a perch from which she could shine. Gin’s generous stipend also allowed her to send a lot more money home to Dasu. Everything in her life seemed to be moving in the right direction.

- Since this was the first time the empress had ever been the regent, the ministers and generals were not quite sure what to expect. Her reputation for possessing a fiery temper filled everyone with trepidation.

    But she soon reassured everyone. She visited the city garrison, thanking the soldiers for defending the capital against acts of sabotage by Théca Kimo’s spies or the remnants of the insurgency in Tunoa; she went to oversee the shipment of grains and feed for the emperor’s expedition in Arulugi; she gathered the scholars and spoke to them about the importance of stability.

- The empress again nodded. “A third question then. Now, suppose an enfeoffed noble ignores threats to his lord’s well-being, offers comfort and succor to his lord’s enemies, instigates discord and harmony in the family of his lord, forms factions and parties among his lord’s followers, what shall the lord do with him?”

- Zomi wasn’t used to such morose sentiments coming from the queen. She wondered whether it was because Gin still felt some trepidation at being summoned by the empress out of the blue. The messenger had explained that the empress wished to discuss the rebellion in Arulugi, and that as time was of the essence, Gin had to leave right away in the Imperial messenger airship. The ship’s small capacity allowed Gin only a single attendant, and she chose Zomi Kidosu. She had none of her guards and trusted generals with her.

- “Zomi, do you know who Aya’s father is?” asked Gin.

    The question surprised Zomi. She had always assumed that this was a topic that Gin did not wish to broach.

    “You know him,” said Gin. “You are the daughter of his mind as Aya is the daughter of his flesh.”

    Zomi was stunned by the revelation.

    “Aya does not know the truth. I’ve always hidden it from her because . . . I suppose I wanted her to be prouder of me than of her father. Vanity is a sin none of us can be free from. I’ve never told him either because . . . I wanted him to stay because of me, not because of duty.

- Cogo remained kneeling with his forehead to the ground. But when it was clear that the empress would not go on until he gave an answer, he spoke reluctantly, pausing between words, “There must be ironclad proof, lest the people speak ill of Your Imperial Majesty.”

    Jia waved her hand, and Chatelain Otho Krin came forward. “Spies have returned with a new report from Géjira. Queen Mazoti feasts every night with Noda Mi and Doru Solofi, as well as many of their followers.”

    Jia waited.

    Cogo looked up. “I serve the emperor,” he said. Then he bowed again and touched his forehead to the ground. “And the empress.”

    The other ministers, generals, and nobles bowed and said together, “I serve the emperor and the empress.”

    Jia looked impassively at them and nodded, once.

    She seethed as she wiped herself. She thought about the muddy hut she had grown up in; she thought about her mother going to Master Ikigégé’s house to wash the floor and clean the toilets; she thought about her own childhood spent hauling fish and working the fields until the skin of her hands had grown as rough as the soil itself. Meanwhile, the regent of Dasu was cleaning his ass with silk.

- “I heard that years ago, back on Dasu, Lord Garu himself once dashed out the door of his house without shoes to welcome you back,” said a wistful Gin. She emphasized Lord Garu deliberately, but the empress did not react to her breach of decorum. “He thought you had run away.”

    “Gin,” Cogo whispered. “How could you?” He stepped back.

    “Gin Mazoti,” said the empress. “Do you confess your sins?”

    Gin heard the sharp clang of dozens of swords being unsheathed at once. She couldn’t get up because she was tied in place, and she no longer had her sword with her. She felt the tips of a few swords pressing against her back.

    She laughed mirthlessly. She realized that she wasn’t even surprised.

    “Cogo, my old friend,” she said, “you are the cause of my rise. It is only proper that you are also the cause of my downfall.”

- “I will not give Kuni the satisfaction of having it both ways. He wants to assuage his conscience while his wife does the dirty work of clearing his doubt. He wants the love and trust of his old retainers while they’re disarmed, disgraced, and distanced from the levers of power. He thinks he can have the love of the people as well as the praise of the lords, the loyalty of his old friends as well as the bought affection of old enemies. He thinks he can balance all the forces around him and resolve everything by secret compromise, but in matters of honor, there is only wrong or right.

    “Let him choose and live with his choice.”

Temporary shelters and viewing platforms constructed from bamboo and silk stood in the blank spaces between the carriages.

He had imagined them as sophisticated poets and philosophers who communed with the gods and transcended all material needs.

They poked at the pork and fish, tried some, and then excitedly shouted for more of their companions to join them. They ate ravenously, pushing and shoving each other to get at the food, and soon the pork and fish were gone. The silk was carried back into the camp by two greasy-fingered men.

Since he’s curious about how we’d respond, wouldn’t it be better to show him the might of Dara’s arms in a sandbox than to have him find out through actual warfare?

- Pékyutenryo grinned and said something to his nobles, who all laughed. Then Pékyutenryo picked up the bowl of alcoholic yogurt—the “kyoffir”—and handed it to Ruthi. Ruthi drank from it happily. The strong drink was having a positive effect on his mood.

    “Thank you for your information,” said Pékyutenryo. His accent was heavy, but the words were clearly understandable.

    Ruthi looked over the rim of the kyoffir bowl, stunned. Behind him, Jima and the rest of Ruthi’s men leapt up in alarm. But they were too late. Pékyutenryo’s war club had already crushed Ruthi’s skull, and the other Lyucu nobles made short work of the rest of the delegation from Dara.

- The Lyucu warriors who were ducked down at the center of the fire shelters poked up their war clubs in a rhythmic pattern, and the cover of each tent began to undulate like the surface of the sea.

- The creatures were unlike anything Ra Olu had ever seen, an impossible amalgamation of features from different species: a barrel-shaped body about the size of three or four elephants—using the airships hovering nearby for scale; a serpentlike tail that trailed in the air; two clawed feet, like those on falcons, extended below the belly; a pair of great leathery wings that spanned 120 feet or more; and a long, slender neck topped with a deerlike, antlered head.

- Only now did Ra Olu understand that the initial Lyucu charge had been but a ruse. It was designed to test the strength of the Imperial forces, to lure them into attacking and demonstrating their tactics while the barbarians held them in place until the aerial beasts could be summoned.
Ra Olu knew that he had to be decisive; he had only one chance.

    “Charge!” he gave the order.

He went after the Lyucu with the only weapon he had—a shovel—and they struck him so many times with their clubs that there was nothing but a paste of meat and pulverized bone left in the ground after they were done. . . .”

    “I saw such horrors as the Lyucu entered my village while I hid inside the overturned fishing boat. They killed everyone they thought was too old or sickly or crippled to make good workers, and then made all the mothers strangle their babies so that they would be free to become concubines for the Lyucu warriors. . . .”

If I reveal the truth about Rin’s suicide and your role in all that has happened, the empire will fall apart at the moment when we can least afford it.

- The riders on the back of the garinafin, too excited by the sight of the burning, sinking airships, didn’t see this new flying assailant. The garinafin did see, but for it, the tiny winged contraption was like a gnat or mosquito, and it paid the machine no mind. It was only after the flying drum had landed on the back of the garinafin, in the midst of the riders attached to the webbing in various harnesses, that shouts of surprise and alarm arose. A few of the Lyucu riders unstrapped themselves from their harnesses and climbed up the webbing with their bone clubs, ready to finish off this impudent escapee from the burning airships.

- In addition, the oarsmen were also hard at work, bracing themselves against the oars to slow the ship down even further. Even so, Lutho’s Luck was plowing ahead through the ocean at a fast clip. Behind it, Proud Kunikin and Stone Turtle tacked zigzag courses and sailed as close to the wind as possible, struggling to keep up. As Lutho’s Luck hesitated at the apex of each swell before dipping down into the trough, it almost seemed about to be lifted out of the sea by whatever was attached at the distant end of the cable.

- But at least he had a way to make fire, and that was something. He was immensely cheered: The knowledge he had gained in his travels through Dara was still worth something. Though he was far from home, the sun and the sea still worked as before. A lens still bent light, and fire could be made by harnessing the power of the sun. He could still improve his lot through diligence and ingenuity. Though the gods could not hear his prayers, the universe was knowable.

    The fire eventually went out, but hope had returned to his heart.

- This was a fresh world of wonders, of new sights and new paths. After being alone for so long on the endless sea, the succor of human contact was too sweet for him not to savor it. The inquisitive and respectful prince and princess awakened the teacher in him, who always craved the stimulation of conversing with fresh, young minds. The joy of exploration and discovery was intoxicating, and he could not resist the lure of testing his mettle against an intricate new puzzle.

    And yet, the ever-cautious Luan could not fully suppress his own nagging doubt. He decided to take precautions.

- “Are you from Dara?” a voice asked. It sounded raspy, hesitant, as though the owner was no longer used to speaking aloud. But the accent was not like that of Cudyu and Vadyu—it was redolent with the harmonies of home. “Have you been sent here by Emperor Mapidéré?”

    Luan took another step forward, his heart pounding with excitement. _Could it be? Were Cudyu and Vadyu wrong about everyone having died?_

- For centuries, the Lyucu and the Agon were locked in a stalemate punctuated by occasional, but bloody and indecisive, border skirmishes. However, during the decades immediately before the arrival of the expedition from Dara, the Agon gradually came to dominate both Ukyu and Gondé with an advantage in the number of garinafins. After a series of massacres in which tens of thousands of Lyucu were slaughtered, the Lyucu chieftains rebelled against their king, Pékyu Toluroru, and forced him to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Agon. To show the sincerity of the Lyucu chieftains and Toluroru, the prince of the Lyucu, Tenryo Roatan, was given to the Agon as a hostage.

    “The Agon would come to regret this decision,” said Oga. “Had the boy not been raised as a hostage among them, you and I would also not be conversing today in this underground prison.”

- Toluroru’s surprise rebellion against the Agon proceeded well, and soon the Lyucu had recovered most of their ancestral moiety of the scrublands from their erstwhile conquerors. But warfare was an expensive affair and could not be carried out indefinitely in the scrublands, where harsh winter storms and unpredictable summer droughts made survival the first priority and forced the tribes to continuously seek out new pastures as they migrated across the land. The two nations of Lyucu and Agon, each unable to overcome the other, eventually conceded that they had to, once again, coexist peacefully.

- The other garinafin riders shuddered and scrambled to obey. They mounted their beasts and took off, diving at the riderless Kidia. The foot soldiers followed their training and formed a protective formation around Tenryo, raising their garinafin-hide shields to defend their lord against a final, desperate assault.

    Kidia died within minutes, her body singed and torn to bloody pieces by a coordinated assault from dozens of garinafins.

    Tenryo gathered all the pilots of the garinafins and the squad leaders of his foot soldiers, and ordered one in five executed as an example of the consequences of not following his orders with alacrity. The families of the executed men and women were made into slaves and distributed to the other pilots and squad leaders.

    “Never question my orders,” he said. “Never.”

- “Do not invoke the name of the All-Father,” said Tenryo. “Do not blame your failure on the All-Father, just as I do not attribute my success to Him. It is only the weak who think that the gods care about the affairs of men; the strong know that they make their own path in this world, and the gods always favor those who triumph.”

Every winter, hundreds of men and women die because of lack of food or shelter; where are the All-Father and His son, the Merciful Toryoana of Healing Hands? Every summer, families starve as their cattle fail to make it across the parched landscape to the next watering hole; where are the All-Father and His daughter, Aluro of a Thousand Streams?

- Tenryo waved his arm decisively, and the pilot on the back of the garinafin stuck the speaking trumpet into the base of her mount’s neck and shouted into it.

    The beast lowered its head to the ground and closed its mouth.

    “No!” screamed Kuni Garu, and he let go, falling from the ladder.

    The beast snapped its mouth open, and a red glowing tongue of flames emerged from its maw and swept across the crowd before it.

    Time seemed to slow down. As Kuni fell, he watched the tongue flicking across each man, woman, and child, turning each from a person into a pillar of flames. Their screams rose to a horrifying, synchronized crescendo and then abruptly ceased.

- Mün Çakri gave the order for his men to attack, but they stood rooted to the ground, too shocked to move. The old general, eyes bloodred with fury, rushed straight at Tenryo himself by running through the huddled crowd.

    “Hiyaaaaa!”

    The pékyu chopped his arm through the air. The garinafin snapped its maw shut and snapped it open again, and a new tongue of flames flickered out, instantly incinerating the running figure of Mün Çakri and the men and women and children around him.

    The fiery, dead figure of Mün Çakri continued to run at Pékyu Tenryo, as though the body was being animated by a spirit stronger than life itself. It crashed into the ranks of the Lyucu warriors standing in front of Tenryo, and four or five of the warriors were set afire by the burning body before they could stop him.

    Behind him, another hundred flame pillars replaced a hundred lives.

    She opened her eyes and raised Na-aroénna. The last light of the sun caught its tip as she led the crowd in a chant. The voices swelled until it seemed the very heavens shook and the first twinkling stars trembled.

- Aware of the skepticism directed at her, Théra chose to ignore the climate of mild hostility and threw herself into the work. She labored alongside the other scholars: climbing over the gigantic carcasses with rough cables and sharp hooks, never complaining about the danger; lifting and shifting massive limbs and cutting body parts without showing any sign that such physical labor was beneath her; plunging her arms deep into the blood and fat without concern until her face was spattered with gore and her body steeped in the stench of garinafin viscera. She listened to the talk of the scholars with care, and did not interrupt the discussions with her opinions.

- “How—” Dafiro was stunned. Zomi Kidosu had asked everyone to seek out novel ways of making fire, and this definitely qualified. He asked to see the strange bamboo-and-whale-tooth contraption, which he decided to call a fire tube. There was no metal or flint anywhere on either of the pieces, and he realized that since the cylindrical tooth formed a tight seal against the walls of the bamboo tube, as the tooth was slammed down, air would be trapped at the bottom of the bamboo tube and become compressed. Was that how fire started? Simply by compressing air? The very idea seemed like magic.

- The Lyucu had been pursuing a policy of deliberately impregnating as many native women as possible, Kuni knew. Almost all of these pregnancies were the result of rape. The terror, violence, and brutality of the policy were designed not only to break the spirit of the native population, but also to affirm the Lyucu claim to this land, to put down roots in it. The women warriors of the Lyucu had generally avoided becoming pregnant to preserve their own fighting readiness, and it was obvious that the Lyucu princess’s bond with Timu had been coerced.
But Timu’s face flushed at his restrained words.

In one month, after making proper sacrifices to the All-Father and the gods of Dara, to wit: Cudyufin-Kana, Nalyufin-Rapa, Aluro-Tututika, Péa-Kiji, Toryoana-Rufizo, Diasa-Fithowéo, and Péten-Lutho-Tazu, I and the might of Lyucu will fall upon the shores of unredeemed Dara to reclaim the throne for the legitimate ruler of Dara, Emperor Thaké, my loyal thane, known in the past as Timu._

    _All those who rally to the flag of Emperor Thaké shall be rewarded and all who adhere to the usurper Jia shall be punished._

- When the village families broke open the biscuits on the night of the High-Autumn Festival, they saw to their surprise that in addition to the inked messages on the front of the slips of paper, some of the blank backs of the paper slips were also filled with brown letters. Lady Lon had painstakingly written these messages using an eyebrow brush and fruit juice ink, which remained invisible until the heat of baking caramelized the sugar in the juices.

    Families gathered around these slips of paper to read silently, and then they swallowed the slips.

- Chittering, rasping, rustling, rumbling, the locusts devoured everything in their path. They swarmed over the fields—red, green, gold—and drained them of all color and shape save the tan of bare soil and skeletal, bare branches stripped of all leaves. Rice, wheat, sorghum, taro, sugarcane, grass, weed—everything was ground up by millions of mandibles and then disappeared into millions of winged stomachs.

- he villagers, once they understood what the pékyu had in mind, howled with rage and despair and rushed at the guards who had come to seize the granaries. But a few more swipes of the flaming breath of the garinafins soon quelled the nascent rebellion. The villagers stood by and watched mutely as the granaries were emptied and the garinafins and long-haired cattle feasted upon the food that was meant to supply the villages over the winter.

- “I pity you, old man,” said Tenryo to the supine figure of Kuni Garu. “It must be hard to see your victories come to naught, to see your accomplishments swept away by the vicissitudes of fate and the inconstancy of the gods.”

    Kuni remained oblivious in his slumber, turning and muttering inaudibly.

- The greatest weakness of the fermentation-gas-powered airships, of course, was the flammability of their lift gas. If any of the gasbags sprang a leak, even a spark would cause the entire ship to turn into a fiery bubble. There was not much the marshal could do to reduce the risk, however, as any additional armor for the ship would have increased its weight beyond the power of the weak lift gas. She had to rely on the fortunate happenstance that the Lyucu had not adopted the use of archers, especially not with fire arrows.

    For the same reason, the marshal had to eschew equipping the airships with flamethrowers; instead, Mazoti would have to rely on other surprises.

- “Though all life is an experiment, there are moments of purity of purpose that demand no justification. Today, Dara is under threat of a dark storm that has no comparison. There is no long view that can justify enslavement and capitulation. When the only alternative is death and servitude, I believe all of us know what must be the right choice.”

- “What’s wrong?” shouted Tanvanaki. But the riders on the struck garinafins looked confused. Their mounts were no longer obeying their orders, but flapped their wings laboriously and convulsively, panic evident in their dark, pupilless eyes.

    And then, just like that, the five struck garinafins exploded, turning into five burning, bloody clouds—flesh, bone, leather, viscera, gore rained down upon the stunned Lyucu warriors gazing up at this fantastical display.

- Lines of crackling silkmotic force crisscrossed the body of the garinafin, catching it inside a web of lightning sparks. The glow from the lines of power was so bright that the soldiers closed their eyes as they hung on, willing the power they wielded to hold and destroy the massive beast in front of them.

- Just like the limbs of the frogs in the laboratories that moved through the water and swam with the power of silkmotic force, the marshal’s lifeless arms began to jerk and move, and, guided by the flexing harnesses, they waved the banner of Dara proudly through the air.

    Again and again, Zomi touched the wires to the jars. The act felt like a violation, a desecration of the body. The smell of burning flesh filled her nostrils. She had to hold back her own nausea and continue, knowing that it was the right thing to do, that the marshal would have understood.

    A breeze dissipated the smoke around the bowsprit, revealing the figure of the flag-wielding Gin Mazoti.

    A lone cry rose from the deck of one of the Dara ships.

    “The marshal is alive!”

    “The pékyu is dead!”

    Several voices joined the first, and then several more, until the wave of voices thundered from one end of the sea to the other.

    Gin Mazoti, Marshal of Dara, was once again commanding the forces of Dara, even as her body began to char and smoke from the powerful currents of silkmotic force.

- The questioning voice was mellifluous and gentle, like a cool spring after a march through the desert.

    _You’ve really decided to leave in this form?_

    The replying voice cracked with the weight of age and wisdom, like the back of a turtle shell.

    _I have. It’s not possible to pass through the Wall of Storms as long as I remain an immortal._
